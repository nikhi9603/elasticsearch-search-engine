He is the founder of Huzlers, a fictional news website that attracts about 387,000 unique visitors per month, according to Comscore. That makes it the No. 1 American site tracked by Comscore in a new genre that Huzler's founder calls \"fauxtire\"[2] — not quite The Onion, but not quite PBS.\n\n"

His predictions for 2016[4] that have already happened include the deaths of Prince, Muhammad Ali and Kimbo Slice, a terrible mass shooting and everyone freaking out about a gorilla. He also goes on to say that Hillary Clinton will be elected, and Donald Trump will die. His hoax was quickly debunked by BuzzFeed[5] and Daily Mirror[6] who explained how he edited an old Facebook post.\n\n"

The mobile game inspired a parade of viral hoax stories,[7][8][9] many of which came from a single sketchy website CartelPress[10] a website with connections to one of the more notorious faux news[11] organizations Huzlers. Reyes later came clean and said these Pokémon Go hoaxes[12] went viral by mistake. Many of the published articles on CartelPress[13] were mistaken as real news.\n\n"
