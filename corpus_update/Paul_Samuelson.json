            "text": "\n\nPaul Anthony Samuelson (May 15, 1915 – December 13, 2009) was an American economist, who was the first American to win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. When awarding the prize in 1970, the Swedish Royal Academies stated that he \"has done more than any other contemporary economist to raise the level of scientific analysis in economic theory\".[4] Economic historian Randall E. Parker has called him the \"Father of Modern Economics\",[5] and The New York Times considers him to be the \"foremost academic economist of the 20th century\".[6]\n\nSamuelson was likely the most influential economist of the later half of the 20th century.[7] In 1996, when he was awarded the National Medal of Science, considered to be America's top science-honor, President Bill Clinton commended Samuelson for his \"fundamental contributions to economic science\" for over 60 years.[4] Samuelson considered mathematics to be the \"natural language\" for economists and contributed significantly to the mathematical foundations of economics with his book Foundations of Economic Analysis.[8] He was author of the best-selling economics textbook of all time: Economics: An Introductory Analysis, first published in 1948.[9] It was the second American textbook that attempted to explain the principles of Keynesian economics. It is now in its 19th edition, having sold nearly 4 million copies in 40 languages.[10] James Poterba, former head of MIT's Department of Economics, noted that by his book, Samuelson \"leaves an immense legacy, as a researcher and a teacher, as one of the giants on whose shoulders every contemporary economist stands\".[4]\n\nHe entered the University of Chicago at age 16, during the depths of the Great Depression, and received his PhD in economics from Harvard. After graduating, he became an assistant professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) when he was 25 years of age and a full professor at age 32. In 1966, he was named Institute Professor, MIT's highest faculty honor.[4] He spent his career at MIT, where he was instrumental in turning its Department of Economics into a world-renowned institution by attracting other noted economists to join the faculty, including later winners of the Nobel Prize Robert Solow, Franco Modigliani, Robert C. Merton, Joseph Stiglitz, and Paul Krugman.\n\nHe served as an advisor to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, and was a consultant to the United States Treasury, the Bureau of the Budget and the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Samuelson wrote a weekly column for Newsweek magazine along with Chicago School economist Milton Friedman, where they represented opposing sides: Samuelson, as a self described \"Cafeteria Keynesian\",[7] claimed taking the Keynesian perspective but only accepting what he felt was good in it.[7] By contrast, Friedman represented the monetarist perspective.[11] Together with Henry Wallich, their 1967 columns earned the magazine a Gerald Loeb Special Award in 1968.[12]\n\nSamuelson worked in many theoretical fields, including: consumer theory; welfare economics; capital; finance, particularly the efficient-market hypothesis; public finance, particularly optimal allocation; international economics, particularly the Balassa–Samuelson effect and the Heckscher–Ohlin model; macroeconomics, particularly the overlapping generations model; and market economics.\n\n"

            "text": "Samuelson was born in Gary, Indiana, on May 15, 1915, to Frank Samuelson, a pharmacist, and Ella née Lipton. His family, he later said, was \"made up of upwardly mobile Jewish immigrants from Poland who had prospered considerably in World War I, because Gary was a brand new steel-town when my family went there\".[6] In 1923, Samuelson moved to Chicago where he graduated from Hyde Park High School (now Hyde Park Career Academy). He then studied at the University of Chicago and received his Bachelor of Arts degree there in 1935. He said he was born as an economist, at 8.00am on January 2, 1932, in the University of Chicago classroom.[7] The lecture mentioned as the cause was on the British economist Thomas Malthus, who most famously studied population growth and its effects.[6] Samuelson felt there was a dissonance between neoclassical economics and the way the system seemed to behave; he said Henry Simons and Frank Knight were a big influence on him.[5] He next completed his Master of Arts degree in 1936, and his Doctor of Philosophy in 1941 at Harvard University. He won the David A. Wells prize in 1941 for writing the best doctoral dissertation at Harvard University in economics, for a thesis titled \"Foundations of Analytical Economics\", which later turned into Foundations of Economic Analysis. As a graduate student at Harvard, Samuelson studied economics under Joseph Schumpeter, Wassily Leontief, Gottfried Haberler, and the \"American Keynes\" Alvin Hansen. Samuelson moved to MIT as an assistant professor in 1940 and remained there until his death.[13]\n\nSamuelson's family included many well-known economists, including brother Robert Summers, sister-in-law Anita Summers, brother-in-law Kenneth Arrow and nephew Larry Summers.\n\nDuring his seven decades as an economist, Samuelson's professional positions included:\n\nSamuelson died after a brief illness on December 13, 2009, at the age of 94.[14] His death was announced by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[6] James M. Poterba, an economics professor at MIT and the president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, commented that Samuelson \"leaves an immense legacy, as a researcher and a teacher, as one of the giants on whose shoulders every contemporary economist stands\".[14] Susan Hockfield, the president of MIT, said that Samuelson \"transformed everything he touched: the theoretical foundations of his field, the way economics was taught around the world, the ethos and stature of his department, the investment practices of MIT, and the lives of his colleagues and students\".[15]\n\n"

            "text": "Stanislaw Ulam once challenged Samuelson to name one theory in all of the social sciences that is both true and nontrivial. Several years later, Samuelson responded with David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage: \"That it is logically true need not be argued before a mathematician; that is not trivial is attested by the thousands of important and intelligent men who have never been able to grasp the doctrine for themselves or to believe it after it was explained to them.\"[17]\n\nFor many years, Samuelson wrote a column for Newsweek. One article included Samuelson's most quoted remark and a favorite economics joke:\n\nIn the early editions of his famous, bestselling economics textbook Paul Samuelson joked that GDP falls when a man \"marries his maid\".[19]\n\n"

            "text": "Paul Samuelson's book Foundations of Economic Analysis (1946) is considered his magnum opus. It is derived from his doctoral dissertation, and was inspired by the classical thermodynamic methods.[20] The book proposes to:\n\nin order to derive \"a general theory of economic theories\" (Samuelson, 1983, p. xxvi). The book showed how these goals could be parsimoniously and fruitfully achieved, using the language of the mathematics applied to diverse subfields of economics. The book proposes two general hypotheses as sufficient for its purposes:\n\nIn the first tenet, his views presented the idea that all actors, whether firms or consumers, are striving to maximize something. They could be attempting to maximize profits, utility, or wealth, but it did not matter because their efforts to improve their well-being would provide a basic model for all actors in an economic system.[21] His second tenet was focused on providing insight on the workings of equilibrium in an economy. Generally in a market, supply would equal demand. However, he urged that this might not be the case and that the important thing to look at was a system's natural resting point. Foundations presents the question of how an equilibrium would react when it is moved from its optimal point.[21] Samuelson was also influential in providing explanations on how the changes in certain factors can affect an economic system. For example, he could explain the economic effect of changes in taxes or new technologies.\n\nIn the course of analysis, comparative statics, (the analysis of changes in equilibrium of the system that result from a parameter change of the system) is formalized and clearly stated.\n\nThe chapter on welfare economics \"attempt(s) to give a brief but fairly complete survey of the whole field of welfare economics\" (Samuelson, 1947, p. 252). It also exposits on and develops what became commonly called the Bergson–Samuelson social welfare function. It shows how to represent (in the maximization calculus) all real-valued economic measures of any belief system that is required to rank consistently different feasible social configurations in an ethical sense as \"better than\", \"worse than\", or \"indifferent to\" each other (p. 221).\n\nSamuelson is also author (and since 1985 co-author) of an influential principles textbook, Economics, first published in 1948 (19th ed. as of 2010; multiple reprints). The book sold more than 300,000 copies of each edition from 1961 through 1976 and was translated in the forty-one languages. As of 2018, it has sold over four million copies. William Nordhaus joined as co-author on the 12th edition (1985). Sometime before 1988, it had become the best-selling economics textbook of all time.[22][23][a]\n\nSamuelson was once quoted as saying, \"Let those who will write the nation's laws if I can write its textbooks.\"[24] Written in the shadow of the Great Depression and the Second World War, it helped to popularize the insights of John Maynard Keynes. A main focus was how to avoid, or at least mitigate, the recurring slumps in economic activity.\n\nSamuelson wrote: \"It is not too much to say that the widespread creation of dictatorships and the resulting World War II stemmed in no small measure from the world's failure to meet this basic economic problem [the Great Depression] adequately.\"[25] This reflected the concern of Keynes himself with the economic causes of war and the importance of economic policy in promoting peace.[26][27][28]\n\nSamuelson's book was the second to introduce Keynesian economics to a wide audience, and was by far the most successful. Canadian economist Lorie Tarshis, who had been a student attending Keynes's lectures at Harvard in the 1930s, published in 1947 an introductory textbook that incorporated his lecture notes, titled Elements of Economics.[29][30][31]\n\nThere are 388 papers in Samuelson's Collected Scientific Papers. Stanley Fischer (1987, p. 234) writes that taken together they are \"unique in their verve, breadth of economic and general knowledge, mastery of setting, and generosity of allusions to predecessors\".\n\nSamuelson was co-editor, along with William A. Barnett, of Inside the Economist's Mind: Conversations with Eminent Economists (Blackwell Publishing, 2007), a collection of interviews with notable economists of the 20th century.\n\n"

            "title": "Criticisms",
            "text": "Samuelson's textbook was a watershed in introducing a serious study of business cycles in the economics curriculum. It was particularly timely because it followed the Great Depression, which had only ended because of the fiscal stimulus of World War II. The study of business cycles along with the introduction of the Keynesian approach of aggregate demand set the stage for the macroeconomic revolution in America, which then diffused throughout the world through translations into every major language. Generations of students, who then became teachers, learned their first and most influential lessons from Samuelson's Economics. It attracted many imitators, who became successful in different niches of the college market.\n\nThe text was not without criticism. While it praised the \"mixed economy\" of market and government, some found that too radical and attacked it as socialist. As a precursor to criticisms of Samuelson's Economics textbook, Lorie Tarshis's textbook was attacked by trustees of, and donors to, American colleges and universities as preaching a \"socialist heresy\".[32] Piling on, William F. Buckley, Jr., in his 1951 book, God and Man at Yale, devoted an entire chapter, attacking both Samuelson's and Tarshis' textbooks. For Samuelson's book, Buckley drew from the Educational Examiner and credited it as an \"excellent review of Samuelson's text.\" (\"Note to Chapter Two.\" p. 234)[33][b] For Tarshis' book, Buckley drew from Merwin K. Hart's organization to wit: \"I am also grateful to the National Economic Council for its telling analysis of the Tarshis.\" (\"Note to Chapter Two.\" p. 234)[33] Buckley essentially characterized both as – in the words of Paul Davidson – \"communist inspired\".[33][31] Buckley, for the rest of his life, defended the criticisms set forth in his book.\n\nOne criticism – of a concept that Samuelson added to his Economics textbook – was the comparison of USA growth rates with those of the USSR, which, according to the criticism, was inconsistent with historical GNP differences.[34] The textbook's 1967 edition (7th ed.) extrapolates (projects) the possibility of USSR/US real GNP parity between 1977 and 1995. Each subsequent edition extrapolates a date range further in the future until those graphs were dropped from the 1985 edition (12th ed.).[35]\n\nSamuelson, together with Robert Solow, helped develop and popularize the mathematics of the Phillips Curve.  The curve suggested that unemployment and inflation were inversely related; with the advent of stagflation in the 1970s some economists including Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek attacked the economics based on the Phillips Curve as questionable or mistaken.\n\n"
