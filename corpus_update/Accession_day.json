This was part of the series of events in 1947 by which rule the British Raj was converted into the two new independent Dominions of India and Pakistan, the latter having two territories separated by the whole of northern India. As a Hindu ruler of a state with both Hindu and Muslim subjects, the Maharaja's decision was crucial.\n\nFestivities of the day include holding rallies, lighting firecrackers, singing India's national anthem, and raising the flag of India.[2][3][4]\n\n"

            "text": "The custom of marking this day was inaugurated during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England. Her accession day was celebrated in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth during her reign and also, according to the 19th-century historian Thomas Lathbury, during the reigns of her successors.[6] A \"Form of Prayer and Thanksgiving\" to be used in churches on the anniversary of the queen's accession was published in 1576 and used until 1602.\n\nIn 1568, the tenth anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's accession was marked with the ringing of bells and 17 November became known as \"Queen Elizabeth's Day\" or \"Queene's Day\".[7] As her reign progressed, it was celebrated with increased fervour and, long after her death, it continued to be observed as a day of Protestant rejoicing and expression of anti-Catholic feeling. The observances included triumphal parades and processions, sermons against populism and the burning of the Pope in effigy.[7] After the Great Fire of London (1666), \"these rejoicings were converted into a satirical saturnalia of the most turbulent kind\"; the greatest excesses occurred in the years 1679–81 when wealthy members of political clubs paid for processions and bonfires to arouse the populace to political fervour.[7] The inhabitants of Berry Pomeroy in south Devon reinstated the tradition of Queene's Day in 2005 with a special church service and bonfire.[8]\n\nOn the accession of King James I of England, a form of prayer and thanksgiving was issued for use in all churches \"upon his entry to this kingdom\".[9] In 1625, a new service was issued which was sanctioned by Convocation in 1640 but set aside by Parliament at the Restoration when certain parts of it were included in the special service for 29 May. When King James II acceded the throne, he ordered the preparation of a special form of prayer and thanksgiving for the anniversary of his accession day and a revised version of the old service was prepared and set forth by authority in 1685. The form of words \"the day on which His Majesty began his happy reign\" was first used in this service and has been retained ever since. After falling out of use during the reigns of William III and Mary II, the service was revised and used again during the reign of Queen Anne.[10] King George V's accession day (reigned 1910–36) was 6 May.[11] From 1952 until 2022, Accession Day took place on 6 February, during the reign of Elizabeth II.\n\nThe present monarch, Charles III's, accession day is 8 September and is observed in the United Kingdom by the flying of specific flags and various official functions. In London, a Royal Salute is fired by the guns of the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park and by the Honourable Artillery Company at the Tower of London.[12] Salutes are also fired at Woolwich, Colchester, Edinburgh Castle, Stirling Castle, Cardiff, Belfast, York, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Dover Castle.[13]\n\nSpecial services are required by canon in all cathedrals, churches, and chapels of the Church of England. The Book of Common Prayer provides options for a stand-alone Accession Day service, or for special propers by which any or all of the services of Matins, Evensong and Holy Communion may be altered for the day.[14] The Church's more recent prayer book Common Worship does not provide a full form of service, but refers the user to the Book of Common Prayer; it does, however, provide propers for the Eucharist on 6 February.[15] Although not a legal requirement, special services are also held in some churches of other denominations.  Divine Worship: The Missal provides the following Collect for use at Masses, Mattins, and Evensong in the Catholic Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham:\n\n"
