Flights that were planned but not executed, were destroyed at or shortly after launch, or missed their target entirely are not included. Flights which reached, but failed to return useful scientific data regarding their target, are given a gray background.\n\nThe list is divided between flights that stopped at a destination, and those that flew by their target.\n\n"
