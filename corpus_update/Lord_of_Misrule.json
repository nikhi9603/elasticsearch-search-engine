            "text": "\n\nIn England, the Lord of Misrule – known in  Scotland as the Abbot of Unreason and in France as the Prince des Sots – was an officer appointed by lot during Christmastide to preside over the Feast of Fools. The Lord of Misrule was generally a peasant or sub-deacon appointed to be in charge of Christmas revelries, which often included drunkenness and wild partying.\n\nThe Church in England held a similar festival involving a boy bishop.[1] This custom was abolished by Henry VIII in 1541, restored by the Catholic Mary I and again abolished by Protestant Elizabeth I, though here and there it lingered on for some time longer.[2] On the Continent it was suppressed by the Council of Basel in 1431, but was revived in some places from time to time, even as late as the eighteenth century. In the Tudor period, the Lord of Misrule (sometimes called the Abbot of Misrule or the King of Misrule)[1] is mentioned a number of times by contemporary documents referring to revels both at court and among the ordinary people.[3][4][5]\n\nWhile mostly known as a British holiday custom, some folklorists, such as James Frazer and Mikhail Bakhtin, have claimed that the appointment of a Lord of Misrule comes from a similar custom practised during the Roman celebration of Saturnalia.[6][7] In ancient Rome, from 17 to 23 December (in the Julian calendar), a man chosen to be a mock king was appointed for the feast of Saturnalia, in the guise of the Roman deity Saturn. This hypothesis has been heavily criticized by William Warde Fowler, who claims that, despite the frequency with which Christian traditions arise directly from re-framings of the customs of antiquity, the Christmas custom of the Lord of Misrule during the Christian era and the Saturnalian custom of antiquity may have completely separate origins;[6] the two separate customs, however, can be compared and contrasted.[6][8]\n\n"

            "text": "On 1 January, AD 400, the bishop Asterius of Amasea[9] in Pontus (modern Amasya, Turkey) preached a sermon against the Feast of Calends (\"this foolish and harmful delight\")[10] that describes the role of the mock king in Late Antiquity. The New Year's feast included children arriving at each doorstep, exchanging their gifts for reward:[9][10]\n\nIt contrasted with the Christian celebration held, not by chance, on the adjoining day:\n\nSignificantly, for Asterius the Christian feast was explicitly an entry from darkness into light, and although no conscious solar nature could have been expressed, it is certainly the renewed light at midwinter that was celebrated among Roman pagans, officially from the time of Aurelian, as the \"festival of the birth of the Unconquered Sun\". Meanwhile, throughout the city of Amasea, although entry into the temples and holy places had been forbidden by the decree of Theodosius I (391), the festival of gift-giving when \"all is noise and tumult\" in \"a rejoicing over the new year\" with a kiss and the gift of a coin, went on all around, to the intense disgust and scorn of the bishop:\n\nHonest farmers coming into the city were likely to be jeered at, spanked[11] and robbed. Worse,\n\nHowever, according to the anthropologist James Frazer, there was a darker side to the Saturnalia festival. In Durostorum on the Danube (modern Silistra), Roman soldiers would choose a man from among them to be the Lord of Misrule for thirty days. At the end of that thirty days, his throat was cut on the altar of Saturn. Similar origins of the British Lord of Misrule, as a sacrificial king (a \"temporary king\", as Frazer puts it) who was later put to death for the benefit of all, have also been recorded.[12]\n\nReferences to Frazer's view of this ancient sacrifice were made in the 1973 film The Wicker Man.\n\nWhile the later Roman custom of a Lord of Misrule as a master of revels, a figure of fun and no more than that, is most familiar, there does seem to be some indication of an earlier and more unpleasant aspect to this figure. Frazer recounts:\n\nIn the Tudor period, John Stow in his Survey of London, published in 1603, gives a description of the Lord of Misrule:[1]\n\nThe Lord of Misrule is also referred to by Philip Stubbes in his Anatomie of Abuses (1585) where he states that \"the wilde heades of the parishe conventynge together, chuse them a grand Capitaine (of mischeefe) whom they ennobel with the title Lorde of Misrule\".  He then gives a description of the way they dress colourfully, tie bells onto their legs and \"go to the churche (though the minister be at praier or preachyng) dauncying and swingyng their handercheefes\".\n\n"

            "title": "Decline of the custom in Britain",
            "text": "With the rise of the Puritan party in the 17th century Church of England, the custom of the Lord of Misrule was outlawed as it was deemed \"disruptive\"; even after the Restoration, the custom remained banned and soon became forgotten.[15] In the early 19th century, the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Church ushered in \"the development of richer and more symbolic forms of worship, the building of neo-Gothic churches, and the revival and increasing centrality of the keeping of Christmas itself as a Christian festival\" as well as \"special charities for the poor\" in addition to \"special services and musical events\".[14] Charles Dickens and other writers helped in this revival of the holiday by \"changing consciousness of Christmas and the way in which it was celebrated\" as they emphasized family, religion, gift-giving, and social reconciliation as opposed to the historic revelry common in some places.[14]\n\n"
