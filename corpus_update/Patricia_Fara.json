Fara is also a reviewer of books on history of science.[13]  She has written the award-winning Science: A Four Thousand Year History (2009) [14][15] and Erasmus Darwin: Sex, Science, and Serendipity (2012).[16] Her most recent book is A Lab of One's Own: Science and Suffrage in the First World War\" (2017).[17][18][19] In 2013, Fara published an article in the journal Nature, stressing the fact that biographies of female scientists perpetuate stereotypes.[20]\n\n"
