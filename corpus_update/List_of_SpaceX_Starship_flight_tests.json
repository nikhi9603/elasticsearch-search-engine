It is being designed to take people to Mars and beyond into the Solar System.[10]\n\n"

All test flights have been launched from the Starbase launch site at Boca Chica in southern Texas.[53]\n\nBy August 2021, the iterative development work at the South Texas facility had become focused on the first orbital test flight of the two-stage Starship system.[54]\n\n"

            "title": "Future operational flights",
            "text": "SpaceX has on various occasions made a few public statements about preliminary ideas for future operational orbital flights using the Starship system.  All dates for future flights are speculative, and therefore approximate and \"no earlier than\" (NET) dates.  Moreover, it is difficult to compare the dates in the tables since they have come from different sources and at different times over the past three years.\n\nElon Musk has stated that Starship would fly hundreds of times before launching with humans.[9] A likely use of some of these flights would be to launch Starlink satellites.[95]\n\nThe HLS variant of Starship was selected by NASA in April 2021 to be the lander for the Artemis missions to the Moon. Artemis 3 is intended to be the first human mission to the Moon to use Starship for long-duration crewed lunar landings as part of the Artemis program.\n\nAccording to space journalist Mike Wall in 2020, Musk is said to envision that eventually more than 1,000 Starships could be needed to depart for Mars every 26 months, which could lead to the development of a sustainable Martian city in 50â€“100 years.[117]\n\n"
