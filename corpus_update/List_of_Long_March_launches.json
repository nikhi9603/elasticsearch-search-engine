Launches made with the related Feng Bao 1 carrier rocket are not included.\n\n\n\n\nDue to the size of the list, it has been split into several smaller articles:\n\n"

Of these, 432 were successful, 11 were failures, and 7 were partial failures. The cumulative success rate is 96%.\n\n\n\nA success is a launch that deploys all payloads into the correct orbit without damage. The launch vehicle may experience an anomaly that does not affect the mission. The payload may experience an anomaly that was not caused by the launch.\n\nA partial failure is a launch that reaches orbit, but at least one payload was not deployed into the correct orbit without damage.[2] After a partial failure, a satellite may operate at reduced functionality or with a reduced lifetime. A common type of partial failure occurs when a satellite is deployed into a lower than intended orbit. The satellite can maneuver with its own propulsion system to reach the correct orbit, but this reduces the fuel available for station-keeping and shortens its operational life.[3]\n\nA failure is a launch that destroys the satellite or does not deploy it into earth orbit.\n\n"
