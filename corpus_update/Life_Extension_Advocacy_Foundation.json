It was founded in 2014 and is based in New York City, New York, USA.\n\nIts activities include a news outlet covering aging research,[1] an annual scientific conference on aging in New York City,[2][3] and the nonprofit crowdfunding platform Lifespan.io.[4] As of 2020, the platform has hosted eight successful campaigns, including three research projects by SENS Research Foundation.\n\n"

As of 2020, it contains over 900 news articles, including over 90 interviews with aging and rejuvenation researchers, such as Aubrey de Grey, Judith Campisi, Brian Kennedy, Steve Horvath, David Sinclair, and Gregory Fahy.\n\nIn 2018, LEAF interviewed the Russian geriatrician Valery Novoselov on the questionable case of Jeanne Calment’s exceptional longevity.[5]\n\n"
