Christos Callow Jr created the Internet Science Fiction Theatre Database[2] in 2018 including mainly 21st century plays that feature elements of science fiction, fantasy and horror. In addition to productions of individual plays, the science fiction theatre festival Sci-Fest LA was launched in Los Angeles in 2014, and the festivals of Otherworld and Talos: Science Fiction Theatre Festival of London[3] were both launched in 2015 in Chicago and in London, UK respectively.\n\nPosle milijon godina (After Million of Years), written by Dragutin IliÄ‡ in 1889, is considered the first science fiction theatrical play in the history of the world literature.[4]\n\n"
