            "text": "In 1990, Beatty was crowned the first ever Grand Poetry Slam Champion of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe.[4] One of the prizes for winning the championship title was the book deal that resulted in his first volume of poetry, Big Bank Take Little Bank (1991).[5] This was followed by another book of poetry, Joker, Joker, Deuce (1994), and appearances performing his poetry on MTV and PBS (in the series The United States of Poetry).[6] In 1993, he was awarded a grant from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award.[7]\n\nHis first novel, The White Boy Shuffle (1996), received a positive review in The New York Times from reviewer Richard Bernstein, who called the book \"a blast of satirical heat from the talented heart of Black American life.\"[8] His second novel, Tuff (2000), received a positive notice in Time magazine, where it was described as being \"like an extended rap song, its characters recounting struggle and survival with the bravado of hip-hoppers.\"[9] In 2006, Beatty edited an anthology of African-American humor called Hokum and wrote an article in The New York Times on the same subject.[10] His 2008 novel Slumberland was about an American DJ in Berlin, and reviewer Patrick Neate said: \"At its best, Beatty's writing is shockingly original, scabrous and very funny.\"[11]\n\nIn his 2015 novel The Sellout, Beatty chronicles an urban farmer who tries to spearhead a revitalization of slavery and segregation in a fictional Los Angeles neighborhood. In The Guardian, Elisabeth Donnelly described it as \"a masterful work that establishes Beatty as the funniest writer in America\",[12] while reviewer Reni Eddo-Lodge called it a \"whirlwind of a satire\", going on to say: \"Everything about The Sellout's plot is contradictory. The devices are real enough to be believable, yet surreal enough to raise your eyebrows.\"[13] The book took more than five years to complete.[14]\n\nThe Sellout was awarded the 2015 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction,[15][16] and the 2016 Man Booker Prize.[17][18] Beatty is the first American to have won the Man Booker Prize, for which all English-language novels became eligible in 2014.[19][20]\n\n"
