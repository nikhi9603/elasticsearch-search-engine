            "text": "Shintoho Co. Ltd. (新東宝株式会社, Shintōhō kabushiki kaisha, or New Tōhō Company) was a Japanese movie studio. It was one of the big six film studios (which also included Daiei, Nikkatsu, Shochiku, Toei Company, and Toho) during the Golden Age of Japanese cinema. It was founded by defectors from the original Toho company following a bitter strike in 1947.[1]\n\nTo compete with the other major studios in the horror/supernatural movie field, Shintoho turned out a large group of such films between 1957 and 1960, including a number of period ghost movies and low-budget science fiction films[1] (such as the Starman (Super Giant) series which was designed to compete with rival then-popular characters Planet Prince,[2] Space Chief and Moonlight Mask[3]). Shintoho declared bankruptcy in 1961, its last production being Jigoku.[4]\n\n"

            "text": "Like the other major Japanese movie companies at that time, Shintoho was also recruiting so-called new faces under the name of \"Shintoho Starlet\". Recruitment started in 1951.[5] However, due to the early bankruptcy of Shintoho, the materials have been scattered, and there are many unclear points in the information on successful applicants. One of the successful applicants was the future kickboxing sports-legend Tadashi Sawamura, who acted under pseudonym \"Tetsuya Shiro\".[6]\n\n"
