            "text": "The novel's title is a reference to the flow of arguments in a debate,[3] and a series of these exchanges tell the story.[4] Instead of a single central plot, there are a number of interlinked story lines and recurring themes (as in musical \"counterpoint\").[5] As a roman à clef,[6] many of the characters are based on real people, most of whom Huxley knew personally, such as D. H. Lawrence, Katherine Mansfield, Sir Oswald Mosley, Nancy Cunard, and John Middleton Murry, and Huxley is depicted as the novel's novelist, Philip Quarles.[7]  Huxley described the structure of Point Counter Point within the novel itself, in a stream of consciousness musing of Quarles:  \"The musicalization of fiction.  Not in the symbolist way, by subordinating sense to sound. . . . But on a large scale, in the construction.  Meditate on Beethoven.  The changes of moods, the abrupt transitions . . . More interesting still, the modulations, not merely from one key to another, but from mood to mood.  A theme is stated, then developed, pushed out of shape, imperceptibly deformed, until, though still recognizably the same, it has become quite different. . . . Get this into a novel.  How?  The abrupt transitions are easy enough.  All you need is a sufficiency of characters and parallel, contrapuntal plots.   . . . You alternate the theme.  More interesting, the modulations and variations are also more difficult.  A novelist modulates by reduplicating situations and characters.  He shows several people falling in love, or dying, or praying in different ways -- dissimilars solving the same problem.  Or, vice versa, similar people confronted with dissimilar problems.  In this way you can modulate through all the aspects of your theme, you can write variations in any number of different moods.  Another way: The novelist can assume the god-like creative privilege and simply elect to consider the events in the story in their various aspects -- emotional, scientific, religious, metaphysical, etc.  He will modulate from one to the other -- as, from the aesthetic to the physico-chemical aspect of things, from the religious to the physiological or financial. . . . Put a novelist in the novel.  He justifies aesthetic generalizations, which may be interesting -- at least to me. He also justifies experiment.  Specimens of his work may illustrate other possible or impossible ways of telling a story.\"[8]\n\n"

            "title": "Comparison with Oswald Mosley",
            "text": "Comparisons have been made between the character Everard Webley and his Brotherhood of British Freemen and Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists. However, when Huxley wrote Point Counter Point, Mosley was still a prominent member of the Labour Party and would remain so until 1931. The BUF was not founded until 1932. A number of other fascist groups preceded Mosley, the most prominent being the British Fascists, and possibly one of those may have been Huxley's inspiration. In the 1996 reprint of Point Counter Point, Mosley's son Nicholas discusses the connection in a new introduction to the novel.[11] David Bradshaw has argued that the most likely source for Webley is John Hargrave, the founder of The Kindred of the Kibbo Kift.[12]\n\nAside from the question of which British fascist leader was meant, when the book was written in 1928, Hitler and his Nazi Party were still a marginal force in German politics, and British fascists looked mainly to Fascist Italy, which did not pose any kind of military threat to Britain. That makes a difference for the act of killing the fascist leader. Ten years later, the killing of a British fascist might have been considered a patriotic act, removing a potential collaborator with the Nazis, but in 1928, such an act was simply a pure manifestation of left-wing radicalism.\n\n"
