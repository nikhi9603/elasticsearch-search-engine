            "text": "The Almaty Television Tower (Russian: Алматинская телебашня), or simply Almaty Tower, formally the Koktobe TV Tower (Russian: Телебашня «Коктобе») is a 371.5-metre-high (1,219 ft) steel television tower built between 1975 and 1983 in Almaty, Kazakhstan.  The tower is located on high slopes of Kok Tobe mountain (Kazakh: Көктөбе means \"green hill\") south-east of downtown Almaty. Unlike other similar TV towers, it is not a concrete, but a steel tubular structure. It is the tallest free-standing tubular steel structure in the world.[1]\n\nThe tower is 371.5 m (1,219 ft) tall; its 114 m metal aerial reaches 1000 meters above sea level. It has two observation decks at the height of 146 m and 252 m, which are accessible by two high-speed elevators. It is however not open to the public.\n\nOn the north-western wall of the tower, in honor of the launch of the Soyuz T-12 spacecraft, one of the largest mosaics in the city was installed, 20 meters long and 8 meters high. The authors of the mosaic are unknown. Image of a mosaic of satellites and astronauts. The tower contains several tunnels leading to the bomb shelter.[2]\n\n"

            "text": "The tower was built by the architects Terziev, Savchenko, Akimov and Ostroumov.[1][3] The design of the KM stage was developed in the department of high-rise structures of the Melnikov Central Research and Design Institute of Construction [ru] under the guidance of B. V. Ostroumov, with the participation of \"Fundamentproekt\" (Moscow) and the Kazakh branch of the \"Central Research and Design Institute of Steel and Structures\".[4] The tower's structures were manufactured and assembled by the \"Kazmontazhstroydetal\" and \"Kazstalmontazh\" trusts of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic's \"Minmontazhspetsstroy\".[5]\n\nThe tower entered operation on 1 June 1984, having cost 600 million rubles.[6] In October 1984 there was a fire in the tower: TV transmitter feeders burned due to errors in calculating the distribution of radio radiation power over the antenna panels.[7]\n\n"

In this decree, the status of the Koktobe TV Tower as a monument of local importance was preserved. The boundaries of the protection zones were approved in 2014.[9]\n\n"
