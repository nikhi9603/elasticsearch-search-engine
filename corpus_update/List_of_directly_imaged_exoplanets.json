            "text": "This is a list of extrasolar planets that have been directly observed, sorted by observed separations. This method works best for young planets that emit infrared light and are far from the glare of the star.  Currently, this list includes both directly imaged planets and imaged planetary-mass companions (objects that orbit a star but formed through a binary-star-formation process, not a planet-formation process). This list does not include free-floating planetary-mass objects in star-forming regions or young associations, which are also referred to as rogue planets.\n\nThe data given for each planet is taken from the latest published paper on the planet to have that data. In many cases it is not possible to have an exact value, and an estimated range is instead provided. The lightest, coldest, and oldest planet directly imaged is Proxima Centauri c, which has seven times Earth's mass, an effective temperature of 39 K, and an age of about 4.8 Ga.\nThis list includes the four members of the multi-planet system that orbit HR 8799.\n\n"

Non-Redundant Aperture Masking Interferometry is a method of combining the views of multiple telescopes into a single image, while the other methods are algorithms for combining multiple direct images taken from the same telescope.\n\n"

They may not actually be true exoplanets.\n  †   There is no consensus whether these companions of stars should be considered sub-brown dwarfs or planets\nCheck https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/imaging.html to see more directly imaged planets.
