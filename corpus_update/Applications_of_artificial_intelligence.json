The use of AI in banking can be began in 1987 when Security Pacific National Bank launched a fraud prevention taskforce to counter the unauthorized use of debit cards.[59] Kasisto and Moneystream use AI.\n\nBanks use AI to organize operations, for bookkeeping, invest in stocks, and manage properties. AI can react to changes when business is not taking place.[60] AI is used to combat fraud and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns for any abnormal changes or anomalies.[61][62][63]\n\nThe use of AI in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic theories.[64] For example, AI-based buying and selling platforms estimate individualized demand and supply curves and thus enable individualized pricing. AI machines reduce information asymmetry in the market and thus make markets more efficient.[65]\n\nAlgorithmic trading involves the use of AI systems to make trading decisions at speeds orders of magnitude greater than any human is capable of, making millions of trades in a day without human intervention. Such high-frequency trading represents is a fast-growing sector. Many banks, funds, and proprietary trading firms now have entire portfolios that are AI-managed. Automated trading systems are typically used by large institutional investors, but include smaller firms trading with their own AI systems.[66]\n\nLarge financial institutions use AI to assist with their investment practices. BlackRock's AI engine, Aladdin, is used both within the company and by clients to help with investment decisions. Its functions includes the use of natural language processing to analyze text such as news, broker reports, and social media feeds. It then gauges the sentiment on the companies mentioned and assigns a score. Banks such as UBS and Deutsche Bank use SQREEM (Sequential Quantum Reduction and Extraction Model) to mine data to develop consumer profiles and match them with wealth management products.[67]\n\nOnline lender Upstart uses machine learning for underwriting.[68]\n\nZestFinance's Zest Automated Machine Learning (ZAML) platform is used for credit underwriting. This platform uses machine learning to analyze data including purchase transactions and how a customer fills out a form to score borrowers. The platform is particularly useful to assign credit scores to those with limited credit histories.[69]\n\nAI makes continuous auditing possible. Potential benefits include reducing audit risk, increasing the level of assurance, and reducing audit duration.[70][quantify]\n\nIn the 1980s, AI started to become prominent in finance as expert systems were commercialized. For example, Dupont created 100 expert systems, which helped them to save almost $10 million per year.[71] One of the first systems was the Protrader expert system that predicted the 87-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1986. \"The major junctions of the system were to monitor premiums in the market, determine the optimum investment strategy, execute transactions when appropriate and modify the knowledge base through a learning mechanism.\"[72]\n\nOne of the first expert systems to help with financial plans was PlanPowerm and Client Profiling System, created by Applied Expert Systems (APEX). It was launched in 1986. It helped create personal financial plans for people.[73]\n\nIn the 1990s AI was applied to fraud detection. In 1993 FinCEN Artificial Intelligence System (FAIS) launched. It was able to review over 200,000 transactions per week and over two years it helped identify 400 potential cases of money laundering equal to $1 billion.[74] These expert systems were later replaced by machine learning systems.[75]\n\n"

AI is helping with the high-cost problem of dosing. One study suggested that AI could save $16 billion. In 2016, a study reported that an AI-derived formula derived the proper dose of immunosuppressant drugs to give to transplant patients.[84]\n\nMicrosoft's AI project Hanover helps doctors choose cancer treatments from among the more than 800 medicines and vaccines.[85][86] Its goal is to memorize all the relevant papers to predict which (combinations of) drugs will be most effective for each patient. Myeloid leukemia is one target. Another study reported on an AI that was as good as doctors in identifying skin cancers.[87] Another project monitors multiple high-risk patients by asking each patient questions based on data acquired from doctor/patient interactions.[88] In one study done with transfer learning, an AI diagnosed eye conditions similar to an ophthalmologist and recommended treatment referrals.[89]\n\nAnother study demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot. The team supervised the robot while it performed soft-tissue surgery, stitching together a pig's bowel judged better than a surgeon.[90]\n\nArtificial neural networks are used as clinical decision support systems for medical diagnosis,[91] such as in concept processing technology in EMR software.\n\nOther healthcare tasks thought suitable for an AI that are in development include:\n\nAI-enabled chatbots decrease the need for humans to perform basic call center tasks.[106]\n\nMachine learning in sentiment analysis can spot fatigue in order to prevent overwork.[106] Similarly, decision support systems can prevent industrial disasters and make disaster response more efficient.[107] For manual workers in material handling, predictive analytics may be used to reduce musculoskeletal injury.[108] Data collected from wearable sensors can improve workplace health surveillance, risk assessment, and research.[107][how?]\n\nAI can auto-code workers' compensation claims.[109][110] AI‐enabled virtual reality systems can enhance safety training for hazard recognition.[107] AI can more efficiently detect accident near misses, which are important in reducing accident rates, but are often underreported.[111]\n\nAlphaFold 2 can determine the 3D structure of a (folded) protein in hours rather than the months required by earlier automated approaches and was used to provide the likely structures of all proteins in the human body and essentially all proteins known to science (more than 200 million).[112][113][114][115]\n\n"

DDR1 is involved in cancers and fibrosis which is one reason for the high-quality datasets that enabled these results.[124]\n\nThere are various types of applications for machine learning in decoding human biology, such as helping to map gene expression patterns to functional activation patterns[125] or identifying functional DNA motifs.[126] It is widely used in genetic research.[127]\n\nThere also is some use of machine learning in synthetic biology,[128][129] disease biology,[129] nanotechnology (e.g. nanostructured materials and bionanotechnology),[130][131] and materials science.[132][133][134]\n\nThere are also prototype robot scientists, including robot-embodied ones like the two Robot Scientists, which show a form of \"machine learning\" not commonly associated with the term.[135][136]\n\nSimilarly, there is research and development of biological \"wetware computers\" that can learn (e.g. for use as biosensors) and/or implantation into an organism's body (e.g. for use to control prosthetics).[137][138][139] Polymer-based artificial neurons operate directly in biological environments and define biohybrid neurons made of artificial and living components.[140][141]\n\nMoreover, if whole brain emulation is possible via both scanning and replicating the, at least, bio-chemical brain – as premised in the form of digital replication in The Age of Em, possibly using physical neural networks – that may have applications as or more extensive than e.g. valued human activities and may imply that society would face substantial moral choices, societal risks and ethical problems[142][143] such as whether (and how) such are built, sent through space and used compared to potentially competing e.g. potentially more synthetic and/or less human and/or non/less-sentient types of artificial/semi-artificial intelligence.[additional citation(s) needed] An alternative or additive approach to scanning are types of reverse engineering of the brain.[144][145]\n\n\nA subcategory of artificial intelligence is embodied,[146][147] some of which are mobile robotic systems that each consist of one or multiple robots that are able to learn in the physical world. \nHowever, biological computers, even if both highly artificial and intelligent, are typically distinguished from synthetic, often silicon-based, computers – they could however be combined or used for the design of either. Moreover, many tasks may be carried out inadequately by artificial intelligence even if its algorithms were transparent, understood, bias-free, apparently effective, and goal-aligned and its trained data sufficiently large and cleansed – such as in cases were the underlying or available metrics, values or data are inappropriate. Computer-aided is a phrase used to describe human activities that make use of computing as tool in more comprehensive activities and systems such as AI for narrow tasks or making use of such without substantially relying on its results (see also: human-in-the-loop).[citation needed] A study described the biological as a limitation of AI with \"as long as the biological system cannot be understood, formalized, and imitated, we will not be able to develop technologies that can mimic it\" and that if it was understood this doesn't mean there being \"a technological solution to imitate natural intelligence\".[152] Technologies that integrate biology and are often AI-based include biorobotics.\n\n"

In contrast, there have been concerns in relation to potential AGI or AI capable of embryo space colonization, or more generally natural intelligence-based space colonization, such as \"safety of encounters with an alien AI\",[175][176] suffering risks (or inverse goals),[177][178] moral license/responsibility in respect to colonization-effects,[179] or AI gone rogue (e.g. as portrayed with fictional David⁸ and HAL 9000).

Other methods have been demonstrated based on deep neural networks, from which the name deep fake was taken.\n\nIn September 2018, U.S. Senator Mark Warner proposed to penalize social media companies that allow sharing of deep-fake documents on their platforms.[235]\n\nIn 2018, Vincent Nozick found a way to detect faked content by analyzing eyelid movements.[236] DARPA gave 68 million dollars to work on deep-fake detection.[236]\n\nAudio deep-fakes[237][238] and AI software capable of detecting deep-fakes and cloning human voices have been developed.[239][240]\n\nAI algorithms have been used to detect deepfake videos.[241][242]\n\nAI has been used to compose music of various genres.\n\nDavid Cope created an AI called Emily Howell that managed to become well known in the field of algorithmic computer music.[243] The algorithm behind Emily Howell is registered as a US patent.[244]\n\nIn 2012, AI Iamus created the first complete classical album.[245]\n\nAIVA (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist), composes symphonic music, mainly classical music for film scores.[246] It achieved a world first by becoming the first virtual composer to be recognized by a musical professional association.[247]\n\nMelomics creates computer-generated music for stress and pain relief.[248]\n\nAt Sony CSL Research Laboratory, the Flow Machines software creates pop songs by learning music styles from a huge database of songs. It can compose in multiple styles.\n\nThe Watson Beat uses reinforcement learning and deep belief networks to compose music on a simple seed input melody and a select style. The software was open sourced[249] and musicians such as Taryn Southern[250] collaborated with the project to create music.\n\nSouth Korean singer Hayeon's debut song, \"Eyes on You\" was composed using AI which was supervised by real composers, including NUVO.[251]\n\nNarrative Science sells computer-generated news and reports. It summarizes sporting events based on statistical data from the game. It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses.[252] Automated Insights generates personalized recaps and previews for Yahoo Sports Fantasy Football.[253]\n\nYseop, uses AI to turn structured data into natural language comments and recommendations. Yseop writes financial reports, executive summaries, personalized sales or marketing documents and more in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, and German.[254]\n\nTALESPIN made up stories similar to the fables of Aesop. The program started with a set of characters who wanted to achieve certain goals. The story narrated their attempts to satisfy these goals.[citation needed] Mark Riedl and Vadim Bulitko asserted that the essence of storytelling was experience management, or \"how to balance the need for a coherent story progression with user agency, which is often at odds.\"[255]\n\nWhile AI storytelling focuses on story generation (character and plot), story communication also received attention. In 2002, researchers developed an architectural framework for narrative prose generation. They faithfully reproduced text variety and complexity on stories such as Little Red Riding Hood.[256] In 2016, a Japanese AI co-wrote a short story and almost won a literary prize.[257]\n\nSouth Korean company Hanteo Global uses a journalism bot to write articles.[258]\n\nLiterary authors are also exploring uses of AI. An example is David Jhave Johnston's work ReRites (2017-2019), where the poet created a daily rite of editing the poetic output of a neural network to create a series of performances and publications.\n\nIn video games, AI is routinely used to generate behavior in non-player characters (NPCs). In addition, AI is used for pathfinding. Some researchers consider NPC AI in games to be a \"solved problem\" for most production tasks.[who?] Games with less typical AI include the AI director of Left 4 Dead (2008) and the neuroevolutionary training of platoons in Supreme Commander 2 (2010).[259][260] AI is also used in Alien Isolation (2014) as a way to control the actions the Alien will perform next.[261]\n\nKinect, which provides a 3D body–motion interface for the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One, uses algorithms that emerged from AI research.[262][which?]\n\nAI like \"Disco Diffusion\", \"DALL·E\" (1 and 2),[263][264] Stable Diffusion,[264][265] Imagen,[266] \"Dream by Wombo\",[267][268][269] Midjourney[270] has also been used for visualizing conceptual inputs such as song lyrics, certain texts or specific imagined concepts (or imaginations) in artistic ways or artistic images in general.[271] Some of the tools also allow users to input images and various parameters e.g. to display an object or product in various environments, some can replicate artistic styles of popular artists, and some can create elaborate artistic images from rough sketches.\n\nAI has been used to produce visual art. The first AI art program, called AARON, was developed by Harold Cohen in 1968 at the University of California at San Diego. AARON is the most notable example of AI art in the era of GOFAI programming because of its use of a symbolic rule-based approach to generate technical images.[272] Cohen developed AARON with the goal of being able to code the act of drawing. In its primitive form, AARON created simple black and white drawings. Cohen would later finish the drawings by painting them. Throughout the years, he also began to develop a way for AARON to also paint. Cohen designed AARON to paint using special brushes and dyes that were chosen by the program itself without mediation from Cohen.[273]\n\nIn recent years, AI art has shifted into a new paradigm with the emergence of GAN computer programming, which generates technical images through machine learning frameworks that surpass the need for human operators.[272] One example is Magenta, which began as a research project in 2016 from the Google Brain team that aimed to build programs and algorithms that can generate art and music, without need of human intervention. Other examples of GAN programs that generate art include Artbreeder and DeepDream.\n\nAI art generated from GANs programming challenged the parameters of art and only recently entered the art auction market.[274] On October 25, 2018, Portrait of Edmond Belamy by the Parisian collective, Obvious, was the first art piece created by artificial intelligence to be offered at Christie's Auction House and was sold for $432,500.[275]\n\nThe exhibition \"Thinking Machines: Art and Design in the Computer Age, 1959–1989\" at MoMA provided an overview of AI applications for art, architecture, and design. Exhibitions showcasing the usage of AI to produce art include the 2016 Google-sponsored benefit and auction at the Gray Area Foundation in San Francisco, where artists experimented with the DeepDream algorithm and the 2017 exhibition \"Unhuman: Art in the Age of AI\", which took place in Los Angeles and Frankfurt. In spring 2018, the Association for Computing Machinery dedicated a magazine issue to the subject of computers and art. In June 2018, \"Duet for Human and Machine\", an art piece permitting viewers to interact with an artificial intelligence, premiered at the Beall Center for Art + Technology. The Austrian Ars Electronica and Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna opened exhibitions on AI in 2019. Ars Electronica's 2019 festival \"Out of the box\" explored art's role in a sustainable societal transformation.\n\nIn addition to the creation of original art, research methods that utilize AI have been generated to quantitatively analyze digital art collections. This has been made possible due to large-scale digitization of artwork in the past few decades. Although the main goal of digitization was to allow for accessibility and exploration of these collections, the use of AI in analyzing them has brought about new research perspectives.[276]\n\nTwo computational methods, close reading and distant viewing, are the typical approaches used to analyze digitized art.[277] Close reading focuses on specific visual aspects of one piece. Some tasks performed by machines in close reading methods include computational artist authentication and analysis of brushstrokes or texture properties. In contrast, through distant viewing methods, the similarity across an entire collection for a specific feature can be statistically visualized. Common tasks relating to this method include automatic classification, object detection, multimodal tasks, knowledge discovery in art history, and computational aesthetics.[276] Whereas distant viewing includes the analysis of large collections, close reading involves one piece of artwork.\n\nResearchers have also introduced models that predict emotional responses to art such as ArtEmis, a large-scale dataset with machine learning models that contain emotional reactions to visual art as well as predictions of emotion from images or text.[278]\n\n"

These converters are failure-prone, which can interrupt service and require costly maintenance or catastrophic consequences in mission critical applications.[citation needed] AI can guide the design process for reliable power electronics converters, by calculating exact design parameters that ensure the required lifetime.[279]\n\nMachine learning can be used for energy consumption prediction and scheduling, e.g. to help with renewable energy intermittency management (see also: smart grid and climate change mitigation in the power grid).[280][281][282][283][better source needed]\n\nMany telecommunications companies make use of heuristic search to manage their workforces. For example, BT Group deployed heuristic search[284] in an application that schedules 20,000 engineers. Machine learning is also used for speech recognition (SR), including of voice-controlled devices, and SR-related transcription, including of videos.[285][286]\n\n"

The major development challenge is the complexity of transportation systems that involves independent components and parties, with potentially conflicting objectives.[292]\n\nAI-based fuzzy logic controllers operate gearboxes. For example, the 2006 Audi TT, VW Touareg[citation needed] and VW Caravell feature the DSP transmission. A number of Škoda variants (Škoda Fabia) include a fuzzy logic-based controller. Cars have AI-based driver-assist features such as self-parking and adaptive cruise control.\n\nThere are also prototypes of autonomous automotive public transport vehicles such as electric mini-buses[293][294][295][296] as well as autonomous rail transport in operation.[297][298][299]\n\nThere also are prototypes of autonomous delivery vehicles, sometimes including delivery robots.[300][301][302][303][304][305][306]\n\nAI has been used to optimize traffic management, which reduces wait times, energy use, and emissions by as much as 25 percent.[307]\n\nTransportation's complexity means that in most cases training an AI in a real-world driving environment is impractical. Simulator-based testing can reduce the risks of on-road training.[308]\n\nAI underpins self-driving vehicles. Companies involved with AI include Tesla, WayMo, and General Motors. AI-based systems control functions such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and mapping.[309]\n\nAutonomous trucks are in the testing phase. The UK government passed legislation to begin testing of autonomous truck platoons in 2018.[310] A group of autonomous trucks follow closely behind each other. German corporation Daimler is testing its Freightliner Inspiration.[311]\n\nAutonomous vehicles require accurate maps to be able to navigate between destinations.[312] Some autonomous vehicles do not allow human drivers (they have no steering wheels or pedals).[313]\n\nThe Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Air Operations Division (AOD) uses AI for expert systems. AIs operate as surrogate operators for combat and training simulators, mission management aids, support systems for tactical decision making, and post processing of the simulator data into symbolic summaries.[314]\n\nAircraft simulators use AI for training aviators. Flight conditions can be simulated that allow pilots to make mistakes without risking themselves or expensive aircraft. Air combat can also be simulated.\n\nAI can also be used to operate planes analogously to their control of ground vehicles. Autonomous drones can fly independently or in swarms.[315]\n\nAOD uses the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System, or IFDIS, which is a rule-based expert system using information from TF-30 documents and expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF-30. This system was designed to be used for the development of the TF-30 for the F-111C. The system replaced specialized workers. The system allowed regular workers to communicate with the system and avoid mistakes, miscalculations, or having to speak to one of the specialized workers.\n\nSpeech recognition allows traffic controllers to give verbal directions to drones.\n\nArtificial intelligence supported design of aircraft,[316] or AIDA, is used to help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the design process. The software also allows the user to focus less on the software tools. The AIDA uses rule based systems to compute its data. This is a diagram of the arrangement of the AIDA modules. Although simple, the program is proving effective.\n\nIn 2003 a Dryden Flight Research Center project created software that could enable a damaged aircraft to continue flight until a safe landing can be achieved.[317] The software compensated for damaged components by relying on the remaining undamaged components.[318]\n\nThe 2016 Intelligent Autopilot System combined apprenticeship learning and behavioral cloning whereby the autopilot observed low-level actions required to maneuver the airplane and high-level strategy used to apply those actions.[319]\n\nNeural networks are used by situational awareness systems in ships and boats.[320] There also are autonomous boats.\n\n"

NASNet's performance exceeded all previously published performance on ImageNet.[341]\n\nMachine learning has been used for noise-cancelling in quantum technology,[342] including quantum sensors.[343] Moreover, there is substantial research and development of using quantum computers with machine learning algorithms. For example, there is a prototype, photonic, quantum memristive device for neuromorphic (quantum-)computers (NC)/artificial neural networks and NC-using quantum materials with some variety of potential neuromorphic computing-related applications,[344][345] and quantum machine learning is a field with some variety of applications under development. AI could be used for quantum simulators which may have the application of solving physics and chemistry[346][347] problems as well as for quantum annealers for training of neural networks for AI applications.[348] There may also be some usefulness in chemistry, e.g. for drug discovery, and in materials science, e.g. for materials optimization/discovery (with possible relevance to quantum materials manufacturing[203][204]).[349][350][351][better source needed]\n\nAI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science. Many of their inventions have been adopted by mainstream computer science and are no longer considered AI. All of the following were originally developed in AI laboratories:[352]\n\n"
