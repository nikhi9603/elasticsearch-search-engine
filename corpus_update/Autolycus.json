According to most, he was the son of Hermes[2] and Chione[3] or Philonis.[4] In Ovid's version, Autolycus was conceived after Hermes had intercourse with the virgin Chione.[5] Pausanias  instead states that Autolycus' real father was Daedalion.[6][7] In some accounts, his mother was also called Telauge.[8]\n\nDepending on the source, Autolycus was the husband of Mestra (who could change her shape at will and was a daughter of Erysichthon[9][10]), or of Neaera,[6] or of Amphithea.[11] He became the father of Anticlea (who married Laertes of Ithaca and was the mother of Odysseus[12]) and several sons, of whom only Aesimus, father of Sinon was named.[13] Autolycus' other daughter was Polymede, mother of Jason, the famous Argonaut who led a group of men to find the coveted Golden Fleece.[2]\n\n"

            "text": "Autolycus obtained most of the same skills that his supposed father Hermes possesses, such as the arts of theft and trickery. It was said that he \"loved to make white of black, and black of white, from a hornless animal to a horned one, or from horned one to a hornless\". He was given the gift that his thievery could not be caught by anyone.[3][14]\n\nAutolycus, master of thievery, was also well known for stealing Sisyphus' herd right from underneath him – Sisyphus, who was commonly known for being a crafty king that killed guests, seduced his niece and stole his brothers' throne[15] and was banished to the throes of Tartarus by the gods.\n\nHeracles, the great Greek hero, was taught the art of wrestling by Autolycus.[16] However, Autolycus was a source of trouble in Heracles' life, because when Autolycus stole some cattle from Euboea and Eurytus, they accused Heracles of the deed; upon going mad from these accusations, Heracles killed them and another one of Eurytus' sons, Iphitus. This led to Heracles serving three years of punishment to repent the deed.[17]\n\nThrough Anticleia, Autolycus was also the grandfather of the famous warrior Odysseus,[12] and he was responsible for the naming of the child as well. This happened when the nurse of the child Eurycleia \"laid the child upon his knees and spoke, and addressed him: Autolycus, find now thyself a name to give to thy child's own child; be sure he has long been prayed for\". Then Autolycus answered: \"Since I have been angered (ὀδυσσάμενος odyssamenos)[18] with many, both men and women, let the name of the child be Odysseus\".[19]\n\n"
