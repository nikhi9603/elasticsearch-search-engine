Then in 1911, a merger between the Wireless Institute (New York) and the Society of Wireless Telegraph Engineers (Boston) resulted in a society named the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE).\n\nIn January 1913 newly formed IRE published the first issue of the Proceedings of the IRE. Later, a 1000-page special issue commemorated the IRE's fiftieth anniversary in May 1962. One of the founding editors, Alfred Norton Goldsmith, tallied 42 years as the first editor-in-chief. When the IEEE was formed in 1963 as a merger of IRE and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the journal obtained its current name.[3][4]\n\n"
