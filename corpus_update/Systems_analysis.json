            "text": "Systems analysis is \"the process of studying a procedure or business to identify its goal and purposes and create systems and procedures that will efficiently achieve them\". Another view sees system analysis as a problem-solving technique that breaks down a system into its component pieces, and how well those parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose.[1]\n\nThe field of system analysis relates closely to requirements analysis or to operations research. It is also \"an explicit formal inquiry carried out to help a decision maker identify a better course of action and make a better decision than they might otherwise have made.\"[2]\n\nThe terms analysis and synthesis stems from Greek, meaning \"to take apart\" and \"to put together,\" respectively. These terms are used in many scientific disciplines, from mathematics and logic to economics and psychology, to denote similar investigative procedures. The analysis is defined as \"the procedure by which we break down an intellectual or substantial whole into parts,\" while synthesis means \"the procedure by which we combine separate elements or components to form a coherent whole.\"[3] System analysis researchers apply methodology to the systems involved, forming an overall picture.\n\nSystem analysis is used in every field where something is developed. Analysis can also be a series of components that perform organic functions together, such as system engineering. System engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how complex engineering projects should be designed and managed.\n\n"

            "text": "The development of a computer-based information system includes a system analysis phase. This helps produce the data model, a precursor to creating or enhancing a database. There are several different approaches to system analysis. When a computer-based information system is developed, system analysis (according to the Waterfall model) would constitute the following steps:\n\nAnother view outlines a phased approach to the process. This  approach breaks system analysis into 5 phases:\n\nUse cases are widely used system analysis modeling tools for identifying and expressing the functional requirements of a system. Each use case is a business scenario or event for which the system must provide a defined response. Use cases evolved from the object-oriented analysis.\n\n"

            "title": "Practitioners",
            "text": "Practitioners of system analysis are often called up to dissect systems that have grown haphazardly to determine the current components of the system. This was shown during the year 2000 re-engineering effort as business and manufacturing processes were examined as part of the Y2K automation upgrades.[5] Employment utilizing system analysis include system analyst, business analyst, manufacturing engineer, systems architect, enterprise architect, software architect, etc.\n\nWhile practitioners of system analysis can be called upon to create new systems, they often modify, expand, or document existing systems (processes, procedures, and methods). Researchers and practitioners rely on system analysis. Activity system analysis has been already applied to various research and practice studies including business management, educational reform, educational technology, etc.\n\n"
