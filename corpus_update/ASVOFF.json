Since its 2008 debut at the Jeu de Paume National Gallery, it is a three-day festival event showcasing feature films, documentaries, conferences, performances and installations. Participants thus far have included the likes of Mike Figgis, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Erwin Olaf, Nobuyoshi Araki, Wing Shya, Steven Klein, Chris Cunningham, Chloë Sevigny, Ruth Hogben, Georgie Greville, Elisha Smith-Leverock, Waris Ahluwalla, Maison Yves Saint Laurent, Nick Knight, Johan Renck, Jerry Schatzberg, William Klein, Tim Yip, Larry Clark, Ellen Von Unwerth, Bruce Weber, Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin, Indrani, Rossy de Palma and Michael Nyman.\n\nThe festival's main venue, save for one year where it was hosted in Nu Boyana Film Studios, is Paris, but since its beginnings, it participates in fashion movements and events the world over, hosted by institutions such as the Bilbao Guggenheim museum, Milan's Palazzo Morando, and the New York Scope art fair. It also has enjoyed the support of sponsors such as Italian Vogue, Bulgari, Kering and Dom Perignon.[1]\n\n"

She also worked as a costume designer for, amongst others, director Amos Gitai. So the founder of ASVOFF knows how important fashion is in a film.[3]\n\n"

            "text": "Mark Eley of Eley Kishimoto commissioned her to make a road movie for the launch of his new menswear line.[4] It was a short film that documented his participation in the GUMBALL 3000 which was a car race that went from London to Monte Carlo. The 18-minute film was called The Adventure of Pleasure.[5]\n\nShe showed the film to Dino Dinco, her Los Angeles collaborator at the time, and he asked her if she wanted to screen it in Los Angeles. A day later EGR (Enrique Gonzalez Rangel), her Mexico City contributor, sent her a fashion film that he made, and Pernet posted it on her blog. The idea to create a travelling fashion film festival had been on the back burner for years before Pernet showed Adventure of Pleasure to Dinco. The name \"You Wear It Well\"  was based on a Rod Stewart song. The first fashion film festival, \"You Wear It Well\", launched in August 2006, premiering in Los Angeles at Cinespace. Dinco and Pernet arranged a second edition of \"You Wear It Well\" in 2007.[6][7]\n\nBesides the work of Diane Pernet and EGR, You Wear It Well featured video creations from Maison Martin Margiela, Nick Knight/Alexander McQueen, Jeremy Scott, Bernhard Willhelm, Marcelo Krasilcic, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, NOKI and Ruben Toledo.[8]\n\nIn November 2007 Diane Pernet also co-curated the NOOVO fashion and photography festival in Santiago de Compostela.\n\"You Wear It Well\" was dissolved in 2007 when Pernet with the support of her current producer, David Herman, took the festival from a one-day program to a three-day program and to make it an extension of the ASVOF blog, hence the name ASVOFF (A Shaded View on Fashion Film). In September 2008, ASVOFF was launched in Paris at Jeu de Paume.[9]\n\n"
