            "text": "\n\nSacha Noam Baron Cohen (born 13 October 1971) is an English actor, comedian, producer and screenwriter.[1] He is best known for his creation and portrayal of the fictional satirical characters Ali G, Borat Sagdiyev, Brüno Gehard, and Admiral General Aladeen. He adopts a variety of accents and guises for his characters and interacts with unsuspecting subjects who do not realise they have been set up. At the 2012 British Comedy Awards, he received the Outstanding Achievement Award and accepted the award in-character as Ali G. In 2013, he received the BAFTA Charlie Chaplin Britannia Award for Excellence in Comedy. In 2018, The Times named him among the 30 best living comedians.\n\nBaron Cohen has produced and/or performed in comedic films such as Ali G Indahouse (2002), Borat (2006) and its sequel Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (2020), Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006), Brüno (2009), and The Dictator (2012).

            "title": "Early life",
            "text": "Sacha Noam Baron Cohen was born in the Hammersmith area of London on 13 October 1971,[5] the son of Jewish parents.[6] His mother, photographer Daniella Naomi (née Weiser), was born in Palestine (modern-day Israel) in 1939 to a family of German Jews who had immigrated there.[7][8] His father, editor-turned-clothing store owner Gerald Jerry Baron Cohen (1932–2016), was born in London to a family of Ashkenazi Belarusian Jews who had moved there and to Pontypridd in Wales,[9][10] and was raised in Wales.[11][12][13] Baron Cohen was raised Jewish in London[14] and is fluent in Hebrew.[15] His paternal grandfather, Morris Moses Cohen, added \"Baron\" to his surname.[12][16] His maternal grandmother, Liesel (née Levi), lived in Haifa and trained as a ballet dancer in Germany before fleeing the Nazis in 1936.[11][17][18][19] Baron Cohen has two older brothers: Erran, a composer with whom he has collaborated, and Amnon.[20] His cousins include autism researcher Sir Simon Baron-Cohen, playwright Dan Baron Cohen, and filmmaker Ash Baron-Cohen.[21]\n\nBaron Cohen was first educated at the independent Catholic St Columba's College in St Albans, Hertfordshire, before moving on to attend the independent Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School in Elstree, Hertfordshire.[22] He then studied History with a focus on anti-semitism at Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating in 1993 with upper-second-class honours.[23][24][13] As an undergraduate, he said that he wrote his thesis on Jewish activists in the American civil rights movement.[25] He was a member of the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club, where he performed in shows such as Fiddler on the Roof and Cyrano de Bergerac, as well as in Habonim Dror, a Labour Zionist youth movement.[26]\n\n"

            "title": "Career",
            "text": "Growing up, Baron Cohen played the cello and made his television debut on Fanfare for Young Musicians.[13] He was a fan of Monty Python and Peter Cook, but his greatest comedic influence was Peter Sellers.[27][28] Known for portraying a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, Sellers was referred to by Baron Cohen as \"the most seminal force in shaping [his] early ideas on comedy\".[29] After leaving university, Baron Cohen worked for a time as a fashion model.[26] By the early 1990s, he was hosting a weekly programme on Windsor cable television's local broadcasts with Carol Kirkwood, who later became a BBC weather forecaster. In 1995, Channel 4 was planning a replacement for its series The Word, and disseminated an open call for new television presenters. Baron Cohen sent in a tape of himself in the character of Kristo, an Albanian fictional television reporter (who developed into the Kazakh Borat Sagdiyev), which caught the attention of a producer. Baron Cohen hosted Pump TV from 1995 to 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Baron Cohen began presenting the youth chat programme F2F for Granada Talk TV and had a small role in an advertisement for McCain Microchips, as a chef in a commercial entitled \"Ping Pong\".[30] He took clown training in Paris, at the École Philippe Gaulier, studying under master-clown Philippe Gaulier. Of his former pupil, Gaulier says: \"He was a good clown, full of spirit\"[31] while Baron Cohen remarks of Gaulier, \"Without him, I really do doubt whether I would have had any success in my field\".[32] Baron Cohen made his first feature film appearance in the British comedy The Jolly Boys' Last Stand (2000). Also in 2000, he played the part of Super Greg for a series of TV advertisements for Lee Jeans; the advertisements never aired, but the website for Super Greg created an internet sensation.[33]\n\nBaron Cohen appeared during two-minute sketches as his fashion reporter Brüno on the Paramount Comedy Channel during 1998. He shot to fame with his comic character Ali G, a fictional stereotype of a British suburban male \"chav\" who imitates urban black British hip hop culture and British Jamaican culture, as well as speaking in rude boy-style English with borrowed expressions from Jamaican Patois. Hailing from Staines (a suburban town in Surrey, to the west of London), Ali G started appearing on the British television show The 11 O'Clock Show on Channel 4, which first aired on 8 September 1998. A year after the première of the show, GQ named Baron Cohen comedian of the year.[34] He won Best Newcomer at the 1999 British Comedy Awards, and at the British Academy Television Awards he was nominated for Best British Entertainment Performance.[34]\n\nDa Ali G Show began in 2000, and won the BAFTA for Best Comedy  in the following year.[35] Also in 2000, Baron Cohen as Ali G appeared as the limousine driver in Madonna's 2000 video \"Music\", directed by Jonas Åkerlund, who was also responsible for directing the titles for Da Ali G Show. Baron Cohen is a supporter of the UK charity telethon Comic Relief, which is broadcast on the BBC, and as Ali G interviewed David Beckham and wife Victoria in 2001.[36]\n\nIn a 2001 Channel 4 poll Ali G was ranked eighth on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters.[37][38] In 2002, Ali G was the central character in the feature film Ali G Indahouse, in which he is elected to the British Parliament and foils a plot to bulldoze a community centre in his home town, Staines.[39] His television show was exported to the United States in 2003, with new episodes set there, for HBO.\n\nAt the 2012 British Comedy Awards, 13 years after winning Best Newcomer at the 1999 Comedy Awards, Baron Cohen accepted the Outstanding Achievement Award from Sir Ben Kingsley in the guise of Ali G, and stated: \"I is grown up now. I ain't living in my nan's house any more. I is living in her garage.\"[40] In 2013, he received the BAFTA Charlie Chaplin Britannia Award for Excellence in Comedy.[41]\n\nAli G's interviews with celebrities (often politicians) gained notoriety partly because the subjects were not privy to the joke that Ali G, rather than being a real interviewer, was a comic character played by Baron Cohen. According to Rolling Stone magazine, Baron Cohen would always enter the interview area in character as Ali G, carrying equipment and appearing to be an inconspicuous crew member. He would arrive with a suited man, whom the interviewee naturally thought was the interviewer. Baron Cohen, as Ali G, would sit down to begin conducting the interview by asking the interviewee some preliminary questions. The interviewee, however, would remain under the impression that the smartly dressed director would be conducting the interview until short notice prior to cameras rolling: this would grant an advantage of surprise, whereby the interviewee would be less likely to opt out of the Ali interview prior to its start.[42]\n\nThe Kazakh journalist Borat Sagdiyev was first developed for short skits on F2F on Granada Television in the UK that Baron Cohen presented in 1996–1997, with the character at this time being known as Alexi Krickler.[43] The character remained dormant while Baron Cohen concentrated on his Ali G persona, but with the subsequent success of Ali G, Baron Cohen revisited his Borat character. The character was featured in segments of Da Ali G Show.[44] Borat's sense of humour derives from his mocking of society through outrageous sociocultural viewpoints, his deadpan violation of social taboos and use of vulgar language and behaviour.[45][46]\n\nBorat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, a feature film with Borat Sagdiyev at the centre, was screened at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival and released in the United Kingdom on 2 November 2006, in the United States on 3 November 2006 and Australia 23 November 2006. The film follows Sagdiyev as he and his colleague Azamat Bagatov travel the US to produce a documentary about life in the country, as all the while Sagdiyev attempts to enter into marriage with celebrity Pamela Anderson. The film is a mockumentary which includes interviews with various Americans that poke fun at American culture, as well as sexism, racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism and jingoism. It debuted at the No. 1 spot in the US, taking in an estimated $26.4 million in just 837 theatres averaging $31,600 per theatre.[47]\n\nBaron Cohen won the 2007 Golden Globe for Best Actor – Musical or Comedy, his sixth such award. Although Borat was up for \"Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\", the film lost to Dreamgirls. On 23 January 2007, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He shared his nomination with the film's co-writers, Ant Hines, Peter Baynham, Dan Mazer and Todd Phillips.\n\nAside from the comic elements of his characters, Baron Cohen's performances are interpreted by some as reflecting uncomfortable truths about his audience. He juxtaposes his own Jewish heritage with the anti-Semitism of his character Borat.[48]\n\nIn 2007, Baron Cohen published a travel guide as Borat, with dual titles: Borat: Touristic Guidings To Minor Nation of U.S. and A. and Borat: Touristic Guidings To Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan.[49] On 21 December 2007, Baron Cohen announced he was retiring the character of Borat.[50]\nThe character was brought back on a 2018 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live and appears in the 2020 sequel Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, for which he won another Golden Globe Award.\n\nAnother alter ego Sacha Baron Cohen performed as is 'Brüno', a flamboyantly gay Austrian fashion show presenter who often lures his unwitting subjects into making provocative statements and engaging in embarrassing behaviour, as well as leading them to contradict themselves, often in the same interview. Brüno's main comedic satire pertains to the vacuity and inanity of the fashion and clubbing world. Brüno asks the subjects to answer \"yes or no\" questions with either \"Vassup\" (what's up) or \"Ich don't think so\" (I don't think so); these are occasionally substituted with \"Ach, ja!\" (Ah yes!) or \"Nicht, nicht\" (\"Nicht\" means \"no\" or \"not\" in German). In one segment on Da Ali G Show, he encouraged his guest to answer questions with either \"Keep them in the ghetto\" or \"Train to Auschwitz\".\n\nIn May 2009, at the MTV Movie Awards, Baron Cohen appeared as Brüno wearing a white angel costume, a white jockstrap, white go-go boots, and white wings; and did an aerial stunt where he dropped from a height (using wires) onto Eminem. Baron Cohen landed with his face on Eminem's crotch and with his crotch in Eminem's face, prompting Eminem to exit the venue with fellow rappers D12. Eminem later admitted to staging the stunt with Baron Cohen.[51]\n\nAfter an intense bidding war that included such Hollywood powerhouses as DreamWorks, Sony, and 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures won and paid a reported $42.5 million for the film rights to a collection of interviews Baron Cohen performed as the character Brüno.[52] To create these interviews a number of shill companies and websites were created to draw potential interviewees by creating an illusion of legitimacy.[53] The film was released in July 2009.\n\nBaron Cohen's 2012 film, The Dictator, was described by its press as \"the heroic story of a dictator who risked his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed\".[54] Baron Cohen played Admiral General Aladeen, a dictator from a fictional country called the Republic of Wadiya.[55][56] Borat and Brüno film director Larry Charles directed the film.[57] The main target of the film's satire was Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who was still alive when the film was written.[58] The producers of the film were concerned it would anger Gaddafi, possibly even resulting in a terrorist attack, so they released deliberate misinformation saying that the film was loosely based on a romance novel written by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.[58]\n\nOn 26 February 2012, Baron Cohen was allegedly banned from attending the 84th Academy Awards in his role as Admiral General Aladeen but the rumour was denied by the Academy, saying \"we haven't banned him, he is lying\" but made it clear that \"Cohen is not welcome to use the red carpet as a platform for a promotional stunt\".[59] Baron Cohen eventually appeared at the awards' red carpet with a pair of uniformed female bodyguards, holding an urn which he claimed was filled with the ashes of Kim Jong-il. The \"ashes\", which Baron Cohen admitted to Howard Stern on the Tuesday, 8 May 2012 episode of The Howard Stern Show was flour, were \"accidentally\" spilt onto Ryan Seacrest.\n\nBaron Cohen portrays various characters in Who Is America?, the most prominent and controversial being Erran Morad, an Israeli anti-terrorism expert. The character is referred to as a colonel (and later captain, general, major, sergeant, brigadier, sergeant corporal and lieutenant) in the Israeli military and a former agent of Mossad (or \"not in the Mossad,\" as he often interjects). Before Who Is America? aired on Showtime, some conservative public figures made statements saying that Baron Cohen had deceived them while in character.[60][61][62] Hours before the premiere, Showtime uploaded the \"Kinderguardians\" segment on their YouTube channel, in which Morad explains to Philip Van Cleave, the president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, of the proposal of a new program where children ages 3 to 16 are armed with guns. He also interviews other conservatives, such as Dana Rohrabacher, Joe Wilson, and Joe Walsh, who are openly supportive. Only Matt Gaetz expresses skepticism of Morad's proposal and declines to be in his video.\n\nIn the second episode, Morad teaches Jason Spencer, a Republican state representative from Georgia, how to detect and repel terrorists by taking pictures up a woman's burqa with a selfie stick, walking backwards while baring his buttocks, and yelling racial epithets. After the airing of the episode, Spencer initially refused to step down, stating that he was exploited by the producers. In May 2018, Spencer lost his primary to a political novice, Steven Sainz,[63] but was expected to serve the rest of his term until November.[64] He eventually did step down on 31 July 2018, leaving the seat vacant.[65]\n\nBaron Cohen has denied Who is America? will return for a second season, noting the publicity surrounding the show and his interviews would make it harder for him to dupe guests.[66]\n\nIn 2018, The Times named him among the 30 best living comedians.[67]\n\nBaron Cohen guest-starred in the fifth season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, with Dustin Hoffman, as a guide to Heaven. He also provided the voice of the ring-tailed lemur king, King Julien, in DreamWorks Animation's film series, Madagascar, and appeared as Will Ferrell's arch rival, the French Formula One speed demon Jean Girard, in the hit Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006).[68] He also appeared alongside Johnny Depp in the film Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007) as Signor Adolfo Pirelli, co-starred in Martin Scorsese's adventure film Hugo (2011), and portrayed Thénardier in the 2012 film version of the musical Les Misérables.[69][70][71] He appeared as a BBC News Anchor in Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues (2013).[72]\n\nBaron Cohen has twice presented the MTV Europe Music Awards, first as Ali G on 8 November 2001, in Frankfurt, Germany, and then as Borat on 3 November 2005 in Lisbon, Portugal. Baron Cohen appeared out of character to accept an award at the British Comedy Awards in December 2006. He said at the time that Borat could not make it to the awards as \"he's guest of honour at the Holocaust denial conference in Tehran\",[73] referring to the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust.\n\nIn September 2010, representatives for Baron Cohen confirmed that he was set to play Freddie Mercury in the Bohemian Rhapsody biopic about the rock singer.[74][75] He dropped out of the project in July 2013, citing \"creative differences\" between him and the surviving members of Queen.[76] Queen guitarist Brian May later said that even though the band and Baron Cohen were on good terms, they felt that his presence would be \"distracting\". The role was later played by Rami Malek.[77]  Baron Cohen shot a spread with supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio for Marie Claire magazine to promote the film Brüno.[78]  In 2010, Baron Cohen guest-starred in The Simpsons episode, \"The Greatest Story Ever D'ohed\", as Jakob, a quick-tempered Israeli tour guide.\n\nIn 2012, Baron Cohen and his production company Four By Two Films signed a first-look deal with Paramount Pictures,\n[79] and the deal was renewed in 2014 for three years and a two-film commitment.[80]\n\nIn Baron Cohen's Grimsby (2016; The Brothers Grimsby in the US), he plays the football hooligan brother of a British MI6 spy. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a failure at the box office.[81]\n\nBaron Cohen portrayed political activist/anarchist Abbie Hoffman in the drama The Trial of the Chicago 7, with Aaron Sorkin writing and directing. The film was released in September 2020 to positive reviews.[82]\n\n"

            "text": "In an interview with former Tory MP politician Neil Hamilton in 2000, Ali G offered Hamilton what was allegedly cannabis, which Hamilton accepted and smoked, creating some minor controversy in the British media.[83]\n\nAt the 2006 MTV Movie Awards, Borat introduced Gnarls Barkley's performance of \"Crazy\",[84] where he made a comment about Jessica Simpson, saying that he liked her mouth and that he could see it clearly through her denim pants.[85]\n\nAt the 2006 UK premiere of Borat, he arrived in Leicester Square in a cart pulled by a mule and a number of \"Kazakh women,\" announcing: \"Good evening, gentleman and prostitutes. After this, I stay in a hotel in Kings Cross. We will all drink, wrestle with no clothes on and shoot dogs from the window\".[86]\n\nBaron Cohen has been criticised for the racist or prejudiced comments his characters have made (see Da Ali G Show). HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer has replied to criticism concerning Baron Cohen's characters, \"Through his alter-egos, he delivers an obvious satire that exposes people's ignorance and prejudice in much the same way All in the Family did years ago\".[87] Regarding his portrayal as the anti-Semitic Borat, Baron Cohen says the segments are a \"dramatic demonstration of how racism feeds on dumb conformity, as much as rabid bigotry\", rather than a display of racism by Baron Cohen himself.[88] \"Borat essentially works as a tool. By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice\", Baron Cohen explains.[18] Addressing the same topic in an NPR interview with Robert Siegel, Baron Cohen said, \"I think that's quite an interesting thing with Borat, which is people really let down their guard with him because they're in a room with somebody who seems to have these outrageous opinions. They sometimes feel much more relaxed about letting their own outrageous, politically incorrect, prejudiced opinions come out\".[89]\n\nBaron Cohen, the grandson of a Holocaust survivor, says he also wishes in particular to expose the role of indifference in that genocide. \"When I was in university, there was this major historian of the Third Reich, Ian Kershaw, who said, 'The path to Auschwitz was paved with indifference.' I know it's not very funny being a comedian talking about the Holocaust, but it's an interesting idea that not everyone in Germany had to be a raving anti-Semite. They just had to be apathetic.\"[18] Regarding the enthusiastic response to his song, \"In My Country There Is Problem\" (also known as \"Throw the Jew Down the Well\"), he says, \"Did it reveal that they were anti-Semitic? Perhaps. But maybe it just revealed that they were indifferent to anti-Semitism.\"[18]\n\nBaron Cohen walked onto the runway during the Ágatha Ruiz de la Prada fashion show in Milan on 26 September 2008. In the character of one of his alter-egos Brüno, he was wearing a costume made of velcro. He appeared on the stage with a blanket and items of clothing stuck to his velcro suit. Lights were turned off while security intervened and escorted him off the stage, and the fashion show resumed normally shortly thereafter. Baron Cohen and his team allegedly accessed the fashion show using fake IDs.[90]\n\nThe government of Kazakhstan threatened Baron Cohen with legal action following the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony in Lisbon, and the authority in charge of the country's country-code top-level domain name removed the website that he had created for his character Borat (previously: http://www.borat.kz) for alleged violation of the law—specifically, registering for the domain under a false name. The New York Times, among others, has reported that Baron Cohen (in character as Borat) replied: \"I'd like to state that I have no connection with Mr. Cohen and fully support my government decision to sue this Jew\".[91] He was, however, defended by Dariga Nazarbayeva, a politician and the daughter of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who stated, \"We should not be afraid of humour and we shouldn't try to control everything...\"[92] The deputy foreign minister of Kazakhstan later invited Baron Cohen to visit the country, stating that he could learn that \"women drive cars, wine is made of grapes, and Jews are free to go to synagogues\".[93] After the success of the Borat film, the Kazakh government, including the president, altered their stance on Baron Cohen's parody, tacitly recognising the invaluable press coverage the controversy created for their country.[94]\n\nBaron Cohen encountered another problem around his Borat character. Two of the three University of South Carolina students who appear in Borat sued the filmmakers, alleging that they were duped into signing release forms while drunk, and that false promises were made that the footage was for a documentary that would never be screened in the US. On 11 December 2006, a Los Angeles judge denied the pair a restraining order to remove them from the film. The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2007.[95][96]\n\nOn 22 May 2009, a charity worker at a seniors' bingo game sued Baron Cohen, claiming an incident shot for Brüno at a charity bingo tournament left her disabled.[97] However, the worker later retracted her statement, saying the \"actor never struck her\", but that he \"beat her down emotionally to the point she's now confined to a wheelchair\".[98] The scene did not make the final cut for the film. The case was dismissed in late November 2009 on Anti-SLAPP grounds, with all lawyer's fees to be paid by the charity worker. The dismissal was appealed and upheld on 12 September 2011.[99][100]\n\nOn 30 April 2010, Palestinian Christian grocer Ayman Abu Aita, of the West Bank and former member of Fatah, filed a lawsuit against Baron Cohen, alleging that he had been defamed by false accusations that he was a terrorist in the movie Bruno. Aita included David Letterman in the suit based on comments made during a 7 July 2009 appearance by Baron Cohen on the Late Show with David Letterman.[101] Unlike the other lawsuits, Aita did not sign a release form, and his case centred around whether Baron Cohen's portrayal of Aita was false, not whether he was defrauded.[102] In September 2012, the defamation claim was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, and the court case was dismissed.[103][104][105]\n\nIn 2018, former Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama sued Baron Cohen for $95 million relating to a mock interview in Who is America? and allegations of paedophilia.[106][107] On 13 July 2021, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed the lawsuit after finding that Moore had signed a consent agreement barring his claims. Moore has filed notice of his intent to appeal the decision.[108] On 8 July 2022, Baron Cohen defeated the lawsuit.[109]\n\n"

            "text": "For much of the early part of his career, Baron Cohen tended to avoid doing interviews out of character. However, in 2004, he did the talk show circuit appearing as himself on Late Show with David Letterman, The Opie and Anthony Show, The Howard Stern Show,[110] and others to promote the forthcoming season of his show on HBO. He was also interviewed on NPR's All Things Considered[89] and did an interview with Rolling Stone, published in November 2006, that the magazine labelled as \"his only interview as himself\".[18] He also appeared in an interview out of character with Terry Gross on NPR's Fresh Air on 4 January 2007.[111]\n\nBorat director Larry Charles explains that Baron Cohen generally appears in character partly to \"protect his weakness\", by focusing public interest on his characters rather than himself.[112] His other reason, Newsweek claims, is that Baron Cohen is fiercely private: \"...according to the UK press, his publicists denied that he attended a party for the London premiere of Borat and that a party even occurred\".[112]\n\nBaron Cohen was featured in the Time 100 list for 2007.[113]\n\nSports Illustrated's 6 November 2006 issue contains a column called \"Skater vs. Instigator\", which illustrates various amusing \"parallels\" between Baron Cohen and figure skater Sasha Cohen, ranging from their mutually held personal significance of the number 4[114] to their shared romantic interests in redheads.\n\nOn 28 December 2015, Baron Cohen and his wife, Australian actress Isla Fisher, donated £335,000 ($500,000) to Save the Children as part of a programme to vaccinate children in northern Syria against measles; they donated the same amount to the International Rescue Committee, also aimed at helping Syrian refugees.[115]\n\nIn 2019, Baron Cohen was awarded the Anti-Defamation League's International Leadership Award for opposing bigotry and prejudice. In accepting the award, Baron Cohen gave an impassioned speech directing criticism at internet companies, singling out Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter as part of \"the biggest propaganda machine in history\" and claiming that their rules on hate speech meant \"they would have let Hitler buy ads\".[116][117]\n\nIn June 2020, Baron Cohen crashed the right-wing \"March for Our Rights 3\" protest in Olympia, Washington, a counter-protest to the March for Our Lives demonstration as a result of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Disguised under heavy make-up, Baron Cohen sang a song telling listeners to attack liberals, CNN, the World Health Organization, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates and \"mask-wearers\". The crowd, which initially sang along, realized they were being pranked when counter-protestors recognized Baron Cohen and began laughing. Baron Cohen's security stopped the organizers from taking him off stage and turning off the power, and Baron Cohen was forced to flee in a private ambulance from the now-violent crowd.[118][119] The incident was later revealed to have been organized as part of filming for Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, with Baron Cohen in-character as Borat in disguise.[120]\n\n"

I am proud of my Jewish identity and there are certain things I do and customs I keep.\" He tries to keep kosher and attends synagogue about twice a year.[17] He first acted in theatrical productions with the Labour Zionist youth movement Habonim Dror.[134][135] He spent a year in Israel as a kibbutz volunteer at Rosh HaNikra and Beit HaEmek as part of the Shnat Habonim Dror, as well as taking part in the programme Machon L'Madrichei Chutz La'Aretz for Jewish youth movement leaders.\n\n"
