            "text": "The grains are edible and nutritious. It can be eaten raw when young and milky, but has to be boiled when older.[10]\n\nOne species, Sorghum bicolor,[11] native to Africa with many cultivated forms,[12] is an important crop worldwide, used for food (in the form of grain or sorghum syrup), animal fodder, the production of alcoholic beverages, and biofuels. Sorghum's cultivation has been linked by archeological research back to ancient Sudan around 6,000 to 7,000 BP.[13]\n\nAll sorghums contain phenolic acids, and most contain flavonoids.[14] Sorghum grains are one of the highest food sources of the flavonoid proanthocyanidin.[15] Total phenol content (in both phenolic acids and flavonoids) is correlated with antioxidant activity.[14] Antioxidant activity is high in sorghums having dark pericarp and pigmented testa.[14] The antioxidant activity of sorghum may explain the reduced incidence of certain cancers in populations consuming sorghum.[14]\n\nPopped sorghum is popular as a snack in India. The popped sorghum is similar to popcorn, but the puffs are smaller.[16] Like popcorn, popping sorghum is done by microwave, in a pot, or other similar ways.\nIt may also be used as a flavoring for clarified butter (ghee).\n\nIn China, sorghum flour is used in combination with wheat flour to make noodles and breads.[17]\n\nMost varieties are drought- and heat-tolerant, nitrogen-efficient,[18] and are especially important in arid and semi-arid regions, where the grain is one of the staples for poor and rural people. These varieties form important components of forage in many tropical regions. S. bicolor is an important food crop in Africa, Central America, and South Asia, and is the fifth most important cereal crop grown in the world.[19][20]\n\nGlobal demand for sorghum increased dramatically between 2013 and 2015, when China began purchasing US sorghum crops to use as livestock feed as a substitute for domestically grown corn. China purchased around $1 billion worth of American sorghum per year until April 2018, when China imposed retaliatory duties on American sorghum as part of the trade war between the two countries.[21]\n\n"
