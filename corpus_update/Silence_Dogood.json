A total of 14 letters were sent.  The first letter began:\n\nThe letters poked fun at various aspects of life in colonial America, such as this quote about hoop petticoats:\n\nThe letters were published in The New-England Courant fortnightly, and amused readers.  Some men wrote in offering to marry Ms. Dogood, upon learning she was widowed.[1]\n\nEventually, James found out that all fourteen of the letters had been written by his younger brother, which angered him. Benjamin left his apprenticeship without permission and escaped to Philadelphia.[3]\n\n"

After stealing the United States Declaration of Independence, cryptologist Benjamin Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage), Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), and Dr. Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger) find an Ottendorf cipher hidden in invisible ink on the back of the Declaration. Following the discovery of a Knights Templar riddle, which said \"The key in Silence undetected\", a link between the Silence Dogood letters and the cipher is established. The cipher is used to find the hidden message in the letters, which proves to be another clue.\n\n"
