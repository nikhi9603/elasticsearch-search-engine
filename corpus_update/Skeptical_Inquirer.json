            "title": "Mission statement and goals",
            "text": "Daniel Loxton, writing in 2013 about the mission and goals of the skeptical movement, quoted an editor of the Swedish skeptic magazine Folkvett who felt that SI was a magazine written by '\"old white men, for old white men\"'. He criticized the idea that people wanted to read about the paranormal, Uri Geller and crystal skulls not being relevant any longer. Paul Kurtz in 2009 seemed to share this sentiment and stated that the organization would still research some paranormal subjects as they have expertise in this area, but they would begin to investigate other areas. S.I. \"has reached an historic juncture: the recognition that there is a critical need to change our direction.\" While editor Frazier did expand the scope of the magazine to include topics less paranormal and more that were an attack on science and critical thinking such as climate change denialism, conspiracy theories and the influence of the alt-med movement, Frazier also added that \"paranormal beliefs are still widespread\" and quoted surveys that state that the public, given a list of ten general paranormal topics, will select four as topics they believe in. While the general skeptic community believes that we should not waste more time debunking the paranormal, topics long ago discredited, Frazier says \"millions of Americans accept them today.\"[1]\n\nWriting for Scientific American, Douglas Hofstadter states that the purpose of Skeptical Inquirer magazine is to \"combat nonsense... nonsensical claims are routinely smashed to smithereens.\" He writes that articles are written for everyone that can read English—no special knowledge or expertise is needed; the only requirement is \"curiosity about truth\".[2]\n\n"

            "title": "History",
            "text": "The magazine was originally titled The Zetetic (from the Greek meaning \"skeptical seeker\" or \"inquiring skeptic\"), and was originally edited by Marcello Truzzi.[3]  About a year after its inception a schism developed between the editor Truzzi and the rest of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). The side represented by CSICOP was more \"firmly opposed to nonsense, more willing to go on the offensive and to attack supernatural claims\"[4] and the other side (\"The relativist faction (one member)\"[4], i.e. Truzzi) wanted science and pseudoscience to exist \"happily together\". Truzzi left to start The Zetetic Scholar and CSICOP changed the magazine's name to Skeptical Inquirer.[2]\n\nHistorian Daniel Loxton speculates on the answer to the question that if CSICOP was not the first skeptical publication, why is it considered to be the \"'birth of modern skepticism' (at least for the English-speaking world)\"? Loxton writes that it was because CSICOP organized \"this scholarship collectively [and] comprised a distinct field of study.\" The organization was the first to establish \"best practices... specialist experts... buildings... periodicals and professional writers and researchers.\"[5]\n\n"

            "title": "Influence",
            "text": "Several notable skeptics have described the magazine as influential to the early stages of their development as scientific skeptics.  In 1995, Perry DeAngelis and Steven Novella were friends that played Dungeons and Dragons together until DeAngelis noticed a Skeptical Inquirer magazine on the table in Novella's condo. DeAngelis, also an avid reader of the magazine, pointed out the back page to Novella and said \"What is missing?\" DeAngelis stated that what was missing was a Connecticut skeptic group, he said \"we should do this\" to which Novella agreed. They started the New England Skeptical Society and eventually the Skeptic's Guide to the Universe (SGU) podcast.[10]\n\nWriting for Scientific American, Douglas Hofstadter asked the question, why would Skeptical Inquirer succeed when the only people who read it are people who do not believe in the paranormal? The answer, he says, lies in the back of the magazine in the \"Letters to the Editor\" section. \"Many people write in to say how vital the magazine has been to them, their friends and their students. High school teachers are among the most frequent writers of thank-you notes to the magazine's editors, but I have also seen enthusiastic letters from members of the clergy, radio talk-show hosts and people in many other professions.\"[2]\n\n\nDaniel Loxton, in his essay \"Ode to Joy\" about discovering Skeptical Inquirer magazine as a freshman at his University writes... \nInspired by the four decades of Skeptical Inquirer magazine, an exhibition titled Some Provocations from Skeptical Inquirers by artists Ellen Levy and Patricia Olynyk, was held at the Baruch College Mishkin Gallery in February 2016. Reviewer Eileen G'Sell wrote that the artists \"plumb the depths of the murky ontological sea that is empirical belief.\"[12] Writing for The Brooklyn Rail, reviewer William Corwin stated that the artwork represented \"this built-in confrontation between fact and fiction (which) was the basis of the Skeptical Inquirer itself and its playful willingness to consider the most unlikely phenomena.\"[13]\n\n"
