            "text": "\n\nThe Salakanagara Kingdom is the first historically recorded Indianised kingdom in Western Java. The kingdom existed between 130-362 AD.[1][2]\nClaudius Ptolemaeus (160 AD) wrote about Java in his book, Geographie Hypogenesis. He mentions the name of Argyre Chora (meaning: Silver Nation) in Labadio. According to the historian, Labadio means Dwipa-Javaka, Dwipa-Javaka or Java Dwipa, which is the ancient name of Java Island.\nThere was one kingdom which rule west coast Java in 160 AD, Salakanagara. Salakanagara means “Silver Nation”. It reinforces the theory that Ptolemaeus may have visited Java in 160 AD.[3][4]\nA relatively modern literature in the 17th century  Pustaka Rajya Rajya i Bhumi Nusantara describes Salakanagara as being founded by an Indian merchant from Pallava Kingdom.[3]\n\n"

Compared to its successor, Tarumanagara, the kingdom did not leave any local tangible historical records and relics such as inscriptions or temples ruins. The main source of Salakanagara's history was a manuscript Pustaka Rajya-rajya I Bhumi Nusantara composed in 17th century by a council led by Prince Wangsakerta of Cirebon, and a few Chinese records.[5][6]\n\n"

It was founded by Dewawarman, stylised as Prabu Dharmalokapala Dewawarman Gangga Raksagapura Sagara. Dewawarman was an Indian ambassador or trader sent from India to establish relations with Javadwipa.\n\nAccording to a history record from India[which?], the kingdom ruled Javadwipa from 130 CE to 362 CE. The founder of the kingdom was Aki Tirem. The kings of Salakanagara were:[7]\n\nIndonesian historian Edi S. Ekajati argued that Salakanagara is Argyre. a mythical island of silver in Greek and Roman mythology because Salakanagara means \"country of silver\" in Sanskrit.[8]\n\nSalakanagara was replaced by Tarumanagara.\n\n"

            "text": "Salakanagara was in charge of small kingdoms, which were founded by people from the Dewawarman dynasty (the kings who ruled Salakanagara)[citation needed]. Kingdoms that are subordinate to Salakanagara include:\n\nUjung Kulon Kingdom is located in the Ujung Kulon region and was founded by Senapati Bahadura Harigana Jayasakti (Dewawarman I's younger brother)[citation needed]. When this kingdom was led by Darma Satyanagara, the king married the daughter of Dewawarman III and later became the 4th king in the Kingdom of Salakanagara[citation needed]. When Tarumanagara grew into a large kingdom, Purnawarman (the third Tarumanagara king) conquered the Ujung Kulon Kingdom[citation needed].  Eventually Ujung Kulon Kingdom became the subordinate kingdom of Tarumanagara.  More than that, the Ujung Kulon Royal troops also helped the troops of Wisnuwarman (the fourth king of Tarumanagara) to quell the Cakrawarman rebellion[citation needed].\n\nThe Kingdom of Tanjung Kidul has thousands of cities in Aghrabintapura (now including the South Cianjur region). This kingdom was led by Sweta Liman Sakti (Dewawarman I's second sister)[citation needed].\n\n"

They are Teluk Lada (Pandeglang, Banten), Condet (Jakarta) and Mount Salak (Bogor).\n\nFirst, Rajatapura is mentioned by the Wangsakerta Manuscript as the center of the Salakanagara government, located in Lada Bay (Pandeglang, Banten). In the text, Rajatapura is called a translated city in Java. From this the eight King Dewawarman reigned and controlled trade throughout Java.\n\nSecond, Ciondet or Condet in East Jakarta, which is 30 kilometers from the port of Sunda Kelapa.  This area has a flowing river named Sungai Tiram.  The word \"Oysters\" supports comes from the name of Aki Tirem, in-law of Dewawarman I, founder of Salakanagara.\n\nThird, Mount Salak (Bogor) is a mountain which is a silver-day afternoon compilation. In Sundanese, Salakanagara means Silver Kingdom. In addition, this opinion is also based on the similarity of names between Salaka and Salak.\n\n"
