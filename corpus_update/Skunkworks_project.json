            "title": "Definition",
            "text": "Everett Rogers defined skunkworks as an \"enriched environment that is intended to help a small group of individuals design a new idea by escaping routine organizational procedures.\"[2]\n\nThe term originated during World War II when the P-80 Shooting Star was designed by Lockheed’s Advanced Development Projects Division in Burbank, California, under similar circumstances. A closely guarded incubator was set up in a circus tent next to a plastics factory in Burbank. The strong smells that wafted into the tent made the Lockheed R&D workers think of the foul-smelling  “Skonk Works” factory in Al Capp’s Li'l Abner comic strip.[3]\n\nSkunk Works was run using \"Kelly's 14 Rules\", Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson was the first team leader of Skunk Works and designer of the P-80, U-2, SR-71 and many more. He is described as being an \"organizing genius\".\n\nSince its origination with Skunk Works, the term was generalized to apply to similar high-priority R&D projects at other large organizations which feature a small elite team removed from the normal working environment and given freedom from management constraints.[3]\n\nThe term typically refers to technology projects developed in semi-secrecy, such as Google X Lab.[4][5]  Other famous skunkworks were Microsoft Research, special teams at Boeing, and the lab of about 50 people established by Steve Jobs to develop the Macintosh computer, located behind the Good Earth Restaurant in Cupertino.[2]\n\n"

            "title": "Evolution of the idea",
            "text": "The Economist notes that the expectations for the products developed by skunkworks have changed in the 21st century from \"something that makes their competitors say 'Wow'\" to \"something that makes their competitors' customers say 'Wow'\". Rather than sequestering skunkworks, the companies now tend to promote communication between them and marketing, design, and accounting departments.[3]\n\n"
