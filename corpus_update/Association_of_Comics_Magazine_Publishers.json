Delacorte, Jr., founder of Dell Publishing, which included Dell Comics, served as president,[1] and Manhattan attorney Henry E. Schultz, president of the board of Queens College and a member of the New York City Board of Higher Education, as executive director.[3]\n\nThe ACMP was formed after \"accusations from several fronts charged comic books with contributing to the rising rates of juvenile delinquency\",[1] and city and county ordinances had banned some publications[4] though these were effectively overturned with a March 29, 1948, United States Supreme Court ruling that a 64-year-old New York State law outlawing publications with \"pictures and stories of deeds of bloodshed, lust or crime\" was unconstitutional.[5] Regardless, the uproar increased upon the publication of two articles:\n\nSpencer, West Virginia held a comic-book burning on October 26, 1948.[8] After the Associated Press reported on it, copycat comic-book burnings followed around the country, particularity in Catholic parishes.[9][10]\n\n"

Like the Production Code, it forbid portrayals of crime that might \"throw sympathy against the law\" or \"weaken respect for established authority,\" and prohibited \"ridicule or attack on any religious or racial group.\" \"Sexy, wanton comics\" were not to be published, and divorce was not to be \"treated humorously or represented as glamorous or alluring.\" Comics that complied with the code were offered a \"Seal of Approval.\"\n\n"

Others, such as founding member EC Comics, terminated their participation. Those who continued as members made use of the ACMP seal of approval without any formal process of review. Describing the situation in 1954 at the Senate comic book hearings, Director Schultz said: \"The association, I would say, is out of business and so is the code.\"[12]\n\n"
