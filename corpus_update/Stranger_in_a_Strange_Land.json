            "text": "Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by American author Robert A. Heinlein. It tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, a human who comes to Earth in early adulthood after being born on the planet Mars and raised by Martians, and explores his interaction with and eventual transformation of Terran culture.\n\nThe title \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" is a direct quotation from the King James Bible (taken from Exodus 2:22).[1]\nThe working title for the book was \"A Martian Named Smith\", which was also the name of the screenplay started by a character at the end of the novel.[2]\n\nHeinlein's widow Virginia arranged to have the original unedited manuscript published in 1991, three years after Heinlein's death. Critics disagree[3] about which version is superior.\n\nStranger in a Strange Land won the 1962 Hugo Award for Best Novel and became the first science fiction novel to enter The New York Times Book Review's best-seller list. In 2012, the Library of Congress named it one of 88 \"Books that Shaped America\".[4]\n\n"

            "title": "Plot",
            "text": "The story focuses on a human raised on Mars and his adaptation to and understanding of humans and their culture. It is set in a post-Third World War United States, where organized religions are politically powerful. There is a World Federation of Free Nations, including the demilitarized US, with a world government supported by Special Service troops.\n\nPrior to WWIII the crewed spacecraft Envoy is launched toward Mars, but all contact is lost shortly before landing. Twenty-five years later, the spacecraft Champion makes contact with the inhabitants of Mars and finds a single survivor, Valentine Michael Smith. Born on the Envoy, he was raised entirely by the Martians. He is ordered by them to accompany the returning expedition.\n\nBecause Smith is unaccustomed to the conditions on Earth, he is confined at Bethesda Hospital, where, having never seen a human female, he is attended by male staff only. Seeing that restriction as a challenge, Nurse Gillian Boardman eludes the guards and goes in to see Smith. By sharing a glass of water with him, she inadvertently becomes his first \"water brother\", which is considered to be a profound relationship by the Martians as water on Mars is extremely scarce.\n\nGillian tells her lover, reporter Ben Caxton, about her experience with Smith. Ben explains that as heir to the entire exploration party, Smith is extremely wealthy, and following a legal precedent set during the colonisation of the Moon, he could be considered owner of Mars itself. His arrival on Earth has prompted a political power struggle that puts his life in danger. Ben persuades her to bug Smith's room and publishes stories to bait the government into releasing him. Ben is seized by the government, and Gillian persuades Smith to leave the hospital with her. When government agents catch up with them, Smith makes the agents vanish and then is so shocked by Gillian's terrified reaction that he enters a semblance of catatonia. Gillian, remembering Ben's earlier suggestion, conveys Smith to Jubal Harshaw, a famous author who is also a physician and a lawyer.\n\nSmith continues to demonstrate psychic abilities and superhuman intelligence, coupled with a childlike naïveté. When Harshaw tries to explain religion to him, Smith understands the concept of God only as \"one who groks\", which includes every extant organism. That leads him to express the Martian concept of life as the phrase \"Thou art God\" although he knows that to be a bad translation. Many other human concepts such as war, clothing, and jealousy are strange to him, and the idea of an afterlife is a fact that he takes for granted because Martian society is directed by \"Old Ones\", the spirits of Martians who have \"discorporated\". It is also customary for loved ones and friends to eat the bodies of the dead in a rite similar to Holy Communion. Eventually, Harshaw arranges freedom for Smith and recognition that human law, which would have granted ownership of Mars to Smith, has no applicability to a planet that is already inhabited by intelligent life.\n\nStill inexhaustibly wealthy and now free to travel, Smith becomes a celebrity and is feted by the Earth's elite. He investigates many religions, including the Fosterite Church of the New Revelation, a populist megachurch in which sexuality, gambling, alcohol consumption, and similar activities are allowed and even encouraged and considered \"sinning\" only when they are not under church auspices. The Church of the New Revelation is organized in a complexity of initiatory levels: an outer circle, open to the public; a middle circle of ordinary members, who support the church financially; and an inner circle of the \"eternally saved\", attractive, highly sexed men and women, who serve as clergy and recruit new members. The Church owns many politicians and uses violence against those who oppose it. Smith also has a brief career as a magician in a carnival (performing actual miracles), in which he and Gillian befriend the show's tattooed lady, an \"eternally saved\" Fosterite named Patricia Paiwonski.\n\nEventually, Smith starts a Martian-influenced \"Church of All Worlds\", combining elements of the Fosterite cult (especially the sexual aspects) with Western esotericism, whose members learn the Martian language and thus acquire the ability to truly \"grok\" the nature of reality, granting them psychokinesis. The church is eventually besieged by Fosterites for practicing \"blasphemy\", and the church building is destroyed, but unknown to the public, Smith's followers teleport to safety. Smith is arrested by the police, but escapes and returns to his followers, later explaining to Jubal that his gigantic fortune has been bequeathed to the Church. With that wealth and their new abilities, Church members will be able to reorganize human societies and cultures. Eventually, those who cannot or will not learn Smith's methods will die out, leaving Homo Superior. That incidentally may save Earth from eventual destruction by the Martians, who were responsible for the destruction of the fifth planet eons ago (resulting in the asteroid belt).\n\nSmith is killed by a mob raised against him by the Fosterites. From the afterlife, he speaks briefly to grief-stricken Jubal to dissuade him from suicide. Having consumed a small portion of Smith's remains in keeping with Martian custom, Jubal and some of the Church members return to Jubal's home to regroup and prepare for their new evangelical role founding congregations. Meanwhile, Smith reappears in the afterlife to replace the Fosterites' eponymous founder, amid hints that Smith was an incarnation of the Archangel Michael.\n\n"

            "text": "Heinlein named his main character \"Smith\" because of a speech he made at a science fiction convention regarding the unpronounceable names assigned to extraterrestrials. After describing the importance of establishing a dramatic difference between humans and aliens, Heinlein concluded, \"Besides, whoever heard of a Martian named Smith?\"[2] The title Stranger In a Strange Land is taken from the King James Version of Exodus 2:22, \"And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land\".[1]\n\nIn the preface to the uncut, original version of the book re-issued in 1991, Heinlein's widow, Virginia, wrote: \"The given names of the chief characters have great importance to the plot. They were carefully selected: Jubal means 'the father of all,' Michael stands for 'Who is like God?'\".\n\n"

            "title": "Development",
            "text": "Originally titled The Heretic, the book was written in part as a deliberate attempt to challenge social norms. In the course of the story, Heinlein uses Smith's open-mindedness to reevaluate such institutions as religion, money, monogamy, and the fear of death. Heinlein completed writing it ten years after he had plotted it out in detail. He later wrote, \"I had been in no hurry to finish it, as that story could not be published commercially until the public mores changed. I could see them changing and it turned out that I had timed it right.\"[6]\n\nHeinlein got the idea for the novel when he and his wife Virginia were brainstorming one evening in 1948. She suggested a new version of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894), but with a child raised by Martians instead of wolves. He decided to go further with the idea and worked on the story on and off for more than a decade,[7] believing that contemporary society was not yet ready for it.[8]\n\nHeinlein was surprised that some readers thought the book described how he believed society should be organized, explaining: \"I was not giving answers. I was trying to shake the reader loose from some preconceptions and induce him to think for himself, along new and fresh lines. In consequence, each reader gets something different out of that book because he himself supplies the answers ... It is an invitation to think – not to believe.\"\n\nHis editors at Putnam required him to cut its 220,000-word length down to 160,000 words before publication.\n\nHeinlein himself remarked in a letter he wrote to Oberon Zell-Ravenheart in 1972 that he thought his shorter, edited version was better.[9] Heinlein also added some new material to the shorter version.\n\nThe book was dedicated in part to science fiction author Philip José Farmer, who had explored sexual themes in works such as The Lovers (1952). It was also influenced by the satiric fantasies of James Branch Cabell.\n\n"

            "title": "Reception",
            "text": "Heinlein's deliberately provocative book generated considerable controversy.[10] The free love and commune living aspects of the Church of All Worlds led to the book's exclusion from school reading lists. After it was rumored to be associated with Charles Manson, it was removed from school libraries as well.\n\nWriting in The New York Times, Orville Prescott received the novel caustically, describing it as a \"disastrous mishmash of science fiction, laborious humor, dreary social satire and cheap eroticism\"; he characterized Stranger in a Strange Land as \"puerile and ludicrous\", saying \"when a non-stop orgy is combined with a lot of preposterous chatter, it becomes unendurable, an affront to the patience and intelligence of readers\".[11] Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale rated the novel 3.5 stars out of five, saying \"the book's shortcomings lie not so much in its emancipation as in the fact that Heinlein has bitten off too large a chewing portion\".[12]\n\nDespite such reviews, Stranger in a Strange Land won the 1962 Hugo Award for Best Novel[13] and became the first science fiction novel to enter The New York Times Book Review's best-seller list.[10] In 2012, it was included in a Library of Congress exhibition of \"Books That Shaped America\".[14]\n\nCritics have also suggested that Jubal Harshaw is actually a stand-in for Robert Heinlein himself, based on similarities in career choice and general disposition,[15] though Harshaw is much older than Heinlein was at the time of writing. Literary critic Dan Schneider wrote that Harshaw's belief in his own free will, was one \"which Mike, Jill, and the Fosterites misinterpret as a pandeistic urge, 'Thou art God!'\"[16]\n\n"

            "title": "Influence",
            "text": "The book significantly influenced modern culture in a variety of ways.\n\nA central element of the second half of the novel is the religious movement founded by Smith, the \"Church of All Worlds\", an initiatory mystery religion blending elements of paganism and revivalism, with psychic training and instruction in the Martian language. In 1968, Oberon Zell-Ravenheart (then Tim Zell) founded the Church of All Worlds, a Neopagan religious organization modeled in many ways after the fictional organization in the novel. The spiritual path included several ideas from the book, including polyamory, non-mainstream family structures, social libertarianism, water-sharing rituals, an acceptance of all religious paths by a single tradition, and the use of several terms such as \"grok\", \"Thou art God\", and \"Never Thirst\".\n\nHeinlein objected to Zell's lumping him with other writers such as Ayn Rand and Robert Rimmer; Heinlein felt that those writers used their art for propaganda purposes, while he simply asked questions of the reader, expecting each reader to answer for him- or herself. He wrote to Zell in a letter: \"... each reader gets something different out of the book because he himself supplies the answers. If I managed to shake him loose from some prejudice, preconception or unexamined assumption, that was all I intended to do.\"[17]\n\nThough Heinlein was neither a member nor a promoter of the Church, it was formed including frequent correspondence between Zell and Heinlein, and Heinlein was a paid subscriber to the Church's magazine Green Egg.[citation needed] This Church still exists as a 501(c)(3) recognized religious organization incorporated in California, with membership worldwide, and it remains an active part of the neopagan community.[18]\n\nThe word \"grok\", coined in the novel, made its way into the English language. In Heinlein's invented Martian language, \"grok\" literally means \"to drink\" and figuratively means \"to comprehend\", \"to love\", and \"to be one with\". The word rapidly became common parlance among science fiction fans, hippies, and later computer programmers[19] and hackers,[20] and has since entered the Oxford English Dictionary.[21]\n\nThe profession of Fair Witness, invented for the novel, has been cited in such varied contexts as environmentalism,[22] psychology,[23] technology,[24] digital signatures,[25] and science,[26] as well as in books on leadership[27] and Sufism.[28] A Fair Witness is an individual trained to observe events and report exactly what is seen and heard, making no extrapolations or assumptions. While wearing the Fair Witness uniform of a white robe, they are presumed to be observing and opining in their professional capacity.[29] Works that refer to the Fair Witness emphasize the profession's impartiality, integrity, objectivity, and reliability.[30][31]\n\nAn example from the book illustrates the role of Fair Witness when Anne is asked what color a house is. She answers, \"It's white on this side.\" The character Jubal then explains, \"You see? It doesn’t occur to Anne to infer that the other side is white, too. All the King’s horses couldn’t force her to commit herself... unless she went there and looked – and even then she wouldn’t assume that it stayed white after she left.”[29]\n\nStranger in a Strange Land contains an early description of the waterbed, an invention that made its real-world debut in 1968. Charles Hall, who brought a waterbed design to the United States patent office, was refused a patent on the grounds that Heinlein's descriptions in Stranger in a Strange Land and another novel, Double Star (1956), constituted prior art.[32]\n\n"

            "text": "Two major versions of this book exist:\n\nHeinlein himself remarked in a letter he wrote to Oberon Zell-Ravenheart in 1972 that he thought his shorter, edited version was better. He wrote, \"SISL was never censored by anyone in any fashion. The first draft was nearly twice as long as the published version. I cut it myself to bring it down to a commercial length. But I did not leave out anything of any importance; I simply trimmed all possible excess verbiage. Perhaps you have noticed that it reads \"fast\" despite its length; that is why. ... The original, longest version of SISL ... is really not worth your trouble, as it is the same story throughout—simply not as well told. With it is the brushpenned version which shows exactly what was cut out—nothing worth reading, that is. I learned to write for pulp magazines, in which one was paid by the yard rather than by the package; it was not until I started writing for the Saturday Evening Post that I learned the virtue of brevity.\"[9]\n\nAdditionally, since Heinlein added material while he was editing the manuscript for the commercial release, the 1991 publication of the original manuscript is missing some material that was in the novel when it was first published.[38]\n\nMany editions exist:[39]\n\n"
