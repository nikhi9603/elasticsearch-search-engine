Even though punk genres at times are difficult to segregate, they usually show differing characteristics in overall structures, instrumental and vocal styles, and tempo. However, sometimes a particular trait is common in several genres, and thus punk genres are normally grouped by a combination of traits.\n\n"

Lyrics can vary, but are typically introspective and surreal, and deal with the dark themes of isolation, gloom, disillusionment, loss, life, death, etc.; as can the style, varying from harsh and dark to upbeat, melodic and tongue-in-cheek. Deathrock lyrics and other musical stylistic elements often incorporate the themes of campy horror and sci-fi films, which in turn leads some bands to adopt elements of rockabilly and surf rock.\n\n"

Examples of 2 Tone bands include the Specials, the Selecter and Madness.\n\nAnti-folk (sometimes antifolk or unfolk) is a subgenre of folk music and punk rock that seeks to subvert the earnestness of politically charged 1960s folk music.

Nonetheless, the music tends to sound raw or experimental; it also generally mocks perceived seriousness and pretension in the established mainstream music scene.\n\nCeltic punk is punk rock fused with influences from Celtic music. Often, the bands add Celtic instruments such as bagpipes, fiddle, tin whistle, accordion, mandolin or banjo. Celtic punk bands often play covers of traditional Irish or Scottish folk songs, as well as original compositions.[7] Examples of Celtic punk bands include the Pogues, Flogging Molly, the Real McKenzies and, Dropkick Murphys.\n\nScottish Gaelic punk is a subgenre of punk rock in which bands sing some or all of their music in Scottish Gaelic.

Although originally a subgenre born in the Latin Americas and Spain, the Latin Punk subgenre has grown internationally, providing Latin rock musicians abroad a connection to their roots. Examples of Latin Punk bands include Caracas, Los Furios, and Machetres.\n\nCowpunk or country punk combines punk rock with country music in sound, subject matter, attitude, and style. The term has also been applied to several bands that play a fast form of Southern rock.

Examples of dance-punk bands include: the Rapture, Liars and the Prodigy.\n\nFolk punk combines elements of folk music and punk rock. Its subgenres include Celtic punk and Gypsy punk. Most folk punk musicians perform their own compositions, in the style of punk rock, but using the acoustic guitar and bass, and often adding additional folk instruments, such as mandolins, accordions, banjos or violins.[8] Examples of folk punk bands include Days N Daze, the Pogues, Andrew Jackson Jihad, and the earlier work of Against Me! and Violent Femmes.\n\nGypsy punk mixes traditional Romani music, Klezmer or Eastern European music with punk rock. It typically features violin, acoustic guitar, accordion, and tenor saxophone, along with electric guitar, bass, and drums. Examples of Gypsy punk bands include Gogol Bordello, Motherhead Bug and Zydepunks.\n\nPop punk (also known as punk pop and other names) is a fusion genre that combines elements of punk rock with pop music, to varying degrees.

Bands described as punk metal include Motörhead,[10]Corrosion of Conformity,[11] Manic Street Preachers,[12] English Dogs,[13] Sum 41,[14] Rage Against the Machine[15] and L7.[16]\n\n\"Punk metal\" may also be used to refer to various genres rooted in both heavy metal and punk rock, most notably crossover thrash, a fusion of thrash metal with hardcore punk. Other genres containing or rooted in both punk and heavy metal that may be referred to as \"punk metal\" include crust punk, grindcore, grunge, metalcore, and sludge metal. Furthermore, the new wave of British heavy metal, speed metal, biker metal, and especially thrash metal were all heavily influenced by punk and hardcore punk.\n\nRapcore fuses elements of punk rock, metal, hip hop, rap, and sometimes funk. Notable bands include Transplants, Zebrahead and Dog Eat Dog.\n\nSka punk is a fusion music genre that combines ska and punk rock, often playing down the former's R&B roots. Ska-core is a subgenre of ska punk, blending ska with hardcore punk. The more punk-influenced style often features faster tempos, guitar distortion, onbeat punk-style interludes (usually the chorus), and nasal, gruff, or shouted vocals. The more ska-influenced style features a more developed instrumentation and a cleaner vocal and musical sound. Examples of ska punk bands include Less Than Jake, Operation Ivy and Catch 22. Examples of ska-core bands include the Suicide Machines and the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Voodoo Glow Skulls.\n\nSynthpunk (also known as Electropunk) is a music genre combining elements of electronic music and punk rock. A number of bands use electronics and punk music together although the methods and resulting sounds can differ greatly. This has even led to the creation of more genres such as digital hardcore. Examples include Mindless Self Indulgence, The Prodigy, Atari Teenage Riot and Left Spine Down.\n\n"
