            "text": "\n\n\n\nThe loosu ponnu (transl. Crazy girl) is a stock character predominantly in Tamil cinema and frequently in Telugu cinema, a girl who is portrayed as attractive but naïve and unintelligent. It is regarded as the equivalent of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl and dumb blonde stereotypes in the United States.[1][2] The loosu ponnu trope became increasingly popular in 1990s Tamil cinema when the masculinity of the hero became severely overblown. It has since received criticism for being misogynistic and regressive.[3][4]\n\n"
