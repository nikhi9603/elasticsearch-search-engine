            "title": "History of the field as a discipline",
            "text": "The modern field of science fiction studies is closely related to popular culture studies, a subdiscipline of cultural studies, and film and literature studies.  Because of the ties with futurism and utopian works, there is often overlap with these fields as well.  The field also has spawned subfields, such as feminist science fiction studies.\n\nHowever, the field's roots go back much further, to the earliest commentators who studied representations of the sciences in the arts and literature, and explorations of utopian and social reform impulses in fantastic and visionary works of art and literature.\n\nModern science fiction criticism may have started with Dorothy Scarborough, who in 1917 included a chapter on \"Supernatural Science\" in her doctoral dissertation, published as The Supernatural in Modern English Fiction.[1]\n\nAs the pulp era progressed, shifting science fiction ever further into popular culture, groups of writers, editors, publishers, and fans (often scientists, academics, and scholars of other fields) systematically organized publishing enterprises, conferences, and other insignia of an academic discipline. Much discussion about science fiction took place in the letter columns of early SF magazines and fanzines, and the first book of commentary on science fiction in the US was Clyde F. Beck's Hammer and Tongs, a chapbook of essays originally published in a fanzine.[2]\n\nThe 1940s saw the appearance of three full-scale scholarly works that treated science fiction and its literary ancestors: Philip Babcock Gove's The Imaginary Voyage in Prose Fiction (1941), J. O. Bailey's Pilgrims Through Space and Time (1948), and Marjorie Hope Nicholson's Voyages to the Moon (1949).[3]\n\nPeter Nicholls credits Sam Moskowitz with teaching \"what was almost certainly the first sf course in the USA to be given through a college\": a non-credit course in \"Science Fiction Writing\" at City College of New York in 1953. The first regular, for-credit courses were taught by Mark Hillegas (at Colgate) and H. Bruce Franklin (at Stanford) in 1961.[4] During the 1960s, more science fiction scholars began to move into the academy, founding academic journals devoted to the exploration of the literature and works of science fiction.[5][6]  The explosion of film studies and cultural studies more broadly granted the nascent discipline additional credibility, and throughout the 1970s and 1980s, mainstream scholars such as Susan Sontag[7] turned their critical attention to science fiction.\n\nIn 1982, James Gunn (now Emeritus Professor) established the Center for the Study of Science Fiction as a Kansas Board of Regents Center as a focus for the SF programs he offered at the University of Kansas, beginning in 1969. This was the first such SF organization at a major university.[8]\n\nThe 1990s saw the first academic programs and degree-granting programs established,[9] and the field shows continued steady growth, not surprisingly also at technology-oriented institutions.[10][11]\n\n"
