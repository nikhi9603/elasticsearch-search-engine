            "text": "Before the foundation was founded in March 2009, the SENS research program was mainly pursued by the Methuselah Foundation, co-founded by Aubrey de Grey and David Gobel.\n\nWhen the SENS rejuvenation approach was announced in the 2000s, while some biogerontologists supported the SENS program, many contended that the ultimate goals of de Grey's programme were too speculative given the state of technology and referred to it as \"fantasy rather than science\".[5][6] By mid-2010s, the rejuvenation approach gained traction with multiple startup companies created from SENS research findings. In 2021 Michael Greve pledged another €300 million for rejuvenation biotechnology startup companies.[7][8] In 2021, Underdog Pharmaceuticals, a startup company spun out from a research program at SENS Research Foundation, was awarded an Innovation Passport from the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which intends to streamline the approval program of promising therapies.[9] In August 2021, Aubrey de Grey was suspended from the foundation.[10] The CEO of the SENS Research Foundation, Jim O’Neill left in the preceding July, at the same time de Grey was suspended.[10]\n\n"

It funds research and uses outreach and education in order to expedite the various regenerative medicine research programs that go together to make the SENS project. The foundation also conducts its own student program SRF Education.[11]\n\n"

            "text": "The SENS Research Foundation (SRF) pursues research projects that correspond to the seven categories of cellular damage due to aging:\n\nIn addition to research undertaken in-house at the Research Center in Mountain View, SRF has also taken part in and/or selectively funded extramural research at various other institutions, including Yale University, Harvard University, Cambridge University, University of Texas, Rice University, and University of Arizona.[1]\n\nThe SENS Research Foundation's research advisory board includes Pedro J. J. Alvarez, Anthony Atala, George Church, Judith Campisi, William A. Haseltine, Brian K. Kennedy, Jeanne Loring, María Blasco Marhuenda, Bruce Rittmann, Nadia Rosenthal, Rudolph E. Tanzi, Jan Vijg, Michael D. West, and Vladimir Skulachev.[25]\n\n"

            "title": "Funding source",
            "text": "Owing to the close relationship between SENS Foundation and Methuselah Foundation and their common activities, during reading articles and public reports there are sometimes misunderstanding about their budgets, directions and amounts of donations which can be distributed between these organizations for various purposes.\n\nOn December 9, 2010, Jason Hope, an entrepreneur based in Scottsdale, AZ, pledged a $500,000 donation.[26]\n\nIn 2011, Aubrey de Grey inherited $16.5 million on the death of his mother. Of this he assigned $13 million to fund SENS research, which by 2013 had the effect of roughly doubling the SRF yearly budget to $4 million.[27]\n\nAccording SRF annual reports,\n\nThe Pineapple Fund donated $2 million to SENS in 2017–18,[28][29] that's in addition to $1 million donated to Methuselah Foundation.[30]\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated $2.4 million in 2018.[2][31][32][33] Then in 2020 Vitalik Buterin together with Sam Bankman-Fried and Haseeb Qureshi donated a total of $150,000 to SENS Research Foundation to combat aging and aging-related diseases at the choice of users of Twitter as a result of open voting.[34]\n\nIn 2020, Oculus cofounder Michael Antonov donated $1 million, of which $600,000 was a matching donation.[35][36]\n\n"
