For the purposes of this article, \"asteroid\" refers to minor planets out to the orbit of Neptune, and includes the dwarf planet 1 Ceres, the Jupiter trojans and the centaurs, but not trans-Neptunian objects (objects in the Kuiper belt, scattered disc or inner Oort cloud).

Minor planet numbers are also given to objects of the Kuiper belt, which is similar to the asteroid belt but farther out (around 30–60 AU), whereas asteroids are mostly between 2–3 AU from the Sun and at the orbit of Jupiter 5 AU from the Sun. Also, comets are not typically included under minor planet numbers, and have their own naming conventions.\n\nAsteroids are given a unique sequential identifying number once their orbit is precisely determined. Prior to this, they are known only by their systematic name or provisional designation, such as 1950 DA.\n\n"

            "text": "Estimating the sizes of asteroids from observations is difficult due to their irregular shapes, varying albedo, and small angular diameter. Observations by the Very Large Telescope of most large asteroids were published 2019–2021.[1][2]\n\nThe number of bodies grows rapidly as the size decreases. Based on IRAS data there are about 140 main-belt asteroids with a diameter greater than 120 km.[6] For a more complete list, see List of Solar System objects by size.\n\nThe inner asteroid belt (defined as the region interior to the 3:1 Kirkwood gap at 2.50 AU) has few large asteroids. Of those in the above list, only 4 Vesta, 19 Fortuna, 6 Hebe, 7 Iris and 9 Metis orbit there. (Sort table by mean distance.)\n\nBelow are the sixteen most-massive measured asteroids.[7] Ceres, at a third the estimated mass of the asteroid belt, is half again as massive as the next fifteen put together. The masses of asteroids are estimated from perturbations they induce on the orbits of other asteroids, except for asteroids that have been visited by spacecraft or have an observable moon, where a direct mass calculation is possible. Different sets of astrometric observations lead to different mass determinations; the biggest problem is accounting for the aggregate perturbations caused by all of the smaller asteroids.[8]\n\nThe proportions assume that the total mass of the asteroid belt is 2.39×1021 kg, or (12.4±1.0)×10−10 M☉.[9]\n\nOutside the top four, the ranking of all the asteroids is uncertain, as there is a great deal of overlap among the estimates. \n\nThe largest asteroids with an accurately measured mass, because they have been studied by the probe Dawn, are 1 Ceres with a mass of (939.3±0.5)×1018 kg, and 4 Vesta at (259.076±0.001)×1018 kg. The third-largest asteroid with an accurately measured mass, because it has moons, is 87 Sylvia at (14.76±0.06)×1018 kg.\n\nFor a more complete list, see List of Solar System objects by size. Other large asteroids such as 423 Diotima currently only have estimated masses.[10][11]\n\nOnly Vesta is regularly bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. Under ideal viewing conditions with very dark skies, a keen eye might be able to also see Ceres, as well as Pallas and Iris at their rare perihelic oppositions.[12] The following asteroids can all reach an apparent magnitude brighter than or equal to the +8.3 attained by Saturn's moon Titan at its brightest, which was discovered 145 years before the first asteroid was found owing to its closeness to the easily observed Saturn.\n\nNone of the asteroids in the outer part of the asteroid belt can ever attain this brightness. Even Hygiea and Interamnia rarely reach magnitudes of above 10.0. This is due to the different distributions of spectral types within different sections of the asteroid belt: the highest-albedo asteroids are all concentrated closer to the orbit of Mars, and much lower albedo C and D types are common in the outer belt.\n\nThose asteroids with very high eccentricities will only reach their maximum magnitude rarely, when their perihelion is very close to a heliocentric conjunction with Earth, or (in the case of 99942 Apophis, (152680) 1998 KJ9, (153814) 2001 WN5, and 367943 Duende) when the asteroid passes very close to Earth.\n\n* Apophis will only achieve that brightness on April 13, 2029.[13][14]  It typically has an apparent magnitude of 20–22.\n\nThis list contains the slowest-rotating known minor planets with a period of at least 1000 hours, or 412⁄3 days, while most bodies have rotation periods between 2 and 20 hours. Also see Potentially slow rotators for minor planets with an insufficiently accurate period (U < 2).\n\nThis list contains the fastest-rotating minor planets with a period of less than 100 seconds, or 0.027 hours. Bodies with a highly uncertain period, having a quality of less than 2, are highlighted in dark-grey. The fastest rotating bodies are all unnumbered near-Earth objects (NEOs) with a diameter of less than 100 meters (see table).\n\nAmong the numbered minor planets with an unambiguous period solution are (459872) 2014 EK24, a 60-meter sized stony NEO with a period of 352 seconds, as well as (335433) 2005 UW163 and (60716) 2000 GD65, two main-belt asteroids, with a diameter of 0.86 and 2.25 kilometers and a period of 1.29 and 1.95 hours, respectively (see full list).\n\n"

            "text": "Minor planets with orbital inclinations greater than 90° (the greatest possible is 180°) orbit in a retrograde direction. As of March 2018[update], of the near-800,000 minor planets known, there are only 99 known retrograde minor planets (0.01% of total minor planets known).[15] In comparison, there are over 2,000 comets with retrograde orbits. This makes retrograde minor planets the rarest group of all. High-inclination asteroids are either Mars-crossers (possibly in the process of being ejected from the Solar System) or damocloids. Some of these are temporarily captured in retrograde resonance with the gas giants.[16]\n\n^  the value given when the number of observations is multiplied by the observation arc; larger values are generally better than smaller values depending on residuals.\n\n"

Note there are several cases where a non-numbered minor planets turned out to be a comet, e.g. C/2001 OG108 (LONEOS), which was provisionally designated 2001 OG108.\n\nIn earlier times, before the modern numbering and naming rules were in effect, asteroids were sometimes given numbers and names before their orbits were precisely known. And in a few cases duplicate names were given to the same object (with modern use of computers to calculate and compare orbits with old recorded positions, this type of error no longer occurs). This led to a few cases where asteroids had to be renamed.[22]\n\nAsteroids were originally named after female mythological figures. Over time the rules loosened.\n\nFirst asteroid with non-Classical and non-Latinized name: 64 Angelina (in honor of a research station)\n\nFirst asteroid with a non-feminine name: 139 Juewa (ambiguous) or 141 Lumen\n\nFirst asteroid with a non-feminized man's name: 903 Nealley\n\nLowest-numbered unnamed asteroid (As of 2021[update]): (4596) 1981 QB\n\n"
