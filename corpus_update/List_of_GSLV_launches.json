However, due to sub-optimal performance and lack of fuel the vehicle did not achieve the intended orbit and the satellite had to maneuver itself using onboard fuel to correct the shortfall. ISRO claims the launch to be successful.[1][2] In a 2014 interview, ISRO Chairman K. Radhakrishnan attributed the failure to incorrect mixture ratio used in the cryogenic upper stage.[3][1][4]\n\nThis was the second test flight with indigenous cryogenic stage CE-7.5 and the first successful launch with the CE-7.5. The flight lifted and successfully placed the 1,982 kilograms (4,370 lb) GSAT-14 into the orbit. This flight became the harbinger of successful launch with the indigenous cryogenic stage.[5][6][7]\n\nThis was the fourth consecutive successful flight of GSLV Mk. II with indigenous cryogenic engine. The flight placed the regional satellite South Asia Satellite was previously named as South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Satellite.[8][9][10][11] The satellite was a gift from India to its neighbors to bolsters Prime Minister Narendra Modi's neighborhood first policy[12] Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka are the users of the multi-dimensional facilities provided by the satellite.\n\n"
