McGruder has an older brother.[citation needed]\n\nMcGruder attended the Jesuit school, Loyola Blakefield, from grades seven to nine. Following two years he left the school and transferred to public high school, Oakland Mills High School and the University of Maryland, from which he graduated[5] with a degree in African American Studies.\n\n"

            "text": "The Boondocks began in 1996 as a webcomic on Hitlist.com, one of the first online music websites.[6] At the time, he was also a DJ on The Soul Controllers Mix Show on WMUC. The Boondocks also briefly appeared as a comic strip in the University of Maryland's newspaper The Diamondback during Jayson Blair's tenure as editor-in-chief.[6][7] McGruder signed a deal with the Universal Press Syndicate and in April 1999, the strip began appearing in 160 newspapers.[7]\n\nThe comic strip's main characters are two young African-American brothers, Huey (named after Huey P. Newton) and his younger brother and wannabe gangsta, Riley,[3] from inner-city Chicago who are relocated to live with their grandfather in a sedate suburb. In six months, the comic strip was being distributed to more than 200 publications.[4] Five collections of The Boondocks have been published: All The Rage, Public Enemy #2, A Right To Be Hostile, Fresh for '01: You Suckaz, and Boondocks: Because I Know You Don't Read The Newspaper. An animated television series adaptation of the strip proved successful on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.\n\nMcGruder expressed interest in 2013 about filming a movie featuring The Boondocks TV series supporting character Uncle Ruckus. Gary Anthony Williams would reprise his role. McGruder set a goal of $200,000 for startup donations at uncleruckusmovie.com between January 30 through March 1, 2013, but the campaign ended with 2,667 backers and $129,963.[8]\n\nIn March 2014, The Boondocks was revived for a new season, but without McGruder's involvement as its showrunner.[9] The first episode of the fourth season was first broadcast on April 21, 2014.[10] In 2019, it was announced a fifth season of The Boondocks would be produced with McGruder's involvement. However, the project was cancelled in February 2022, but Sony is looking at alternative options for the series.[citation needed]\n\nAmong his other projects have been the Super Deluxe variety comedy series The Super Rumble Mix Show. McGruder also developed Black Jesus, another comedy series broadcast on Adult Swim, part of Cartoon Network.[9]\n\nMcGruder has developed into a public speaker on political and cultural issues.\nMcGruder said in a 2002 keynote address[11] at the July 12â€“14, 2002 H2K2 conference that he believed that President George W. Bush was involved with the September 11 attacks:\n\n[13][4][14] During a 2003 reception hosted by The Nation, McGruder offended attendees by defiantly expressing his support for Ralph Nader's 2000 presidential bid. McGruder endured heckling and walkouts as he defended his commitment to left-wing causes, including, he claimed, calling Condoleezza Rice a \"mass-murderer\" to her face during the 2002 NAACP Image Awards.[7] In 2009, Richmond, Indiana newspaper Palladium-Item reported that McGruder told a Martin Luther King Day audience at local Earlham College that then-President-elect Barack Obama was not black.[14] McGruder released a statement insisting he was misquoted, while maintaining he remained \"cautiously pessimistic\" about Obama's presidency.[14]\n\nWith Reginald Hudlin, McGruder co-authored a graphic novel, Birth of a Nation: A Comic Novel (2004), about African Americans in East St. Louis during an election.[1] The book's illustrations were drawn by cartoonist Kyle Baker.\n\nIn celebration of Black History Month in 2005, McGruder was invited to provide a lecture at the Miami University of Ohio.[15][16]\n\nIn 2010, McGruder worked as screenwriter in the final treatment of the feature film Red Tails, released in early 2012. Its story is based on the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African American combat pilots during World War II.[17]\n\nIn August 2017, it was announced that McGruder, along with producer Will Packer, will develop a series for Amazon Video called Black America which will be based on an alternative history where emancipated black Americans receive three Southern states as reparations for slavery.[18][19] The series' announcement was reportedly seen as a response to HBO's in-development alternative history series Confederate, whose plot entails a history where the Confederacy won the Civil War.[20]\n\n"
