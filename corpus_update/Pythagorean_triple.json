            "text": "A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers a, b, and c, such that a2 + b2 = c2. Such a triple is commonly written (a, b, c), and a well-known example is (3, 4, 5). If (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple, then so is (ka, kb, kc) for any positive integer k. A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which a, b and c are coprime (that is, they have no common divisor larger than 1).[1] For example, (3, 4, 5) is a primitive Pythagorean triple whereas (6, 8, 10) is not. A triangle whose sides form a Pythagorean triple is called a Pythagorean triangle, and is necessarily a right triangle.\n\nThe name is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, stating that every right triangle has side lengths satisfying the formula \n\n\n\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nb\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}\n\n; thus, Pythagorean triples describe the three integer side lengths of a right triangle.

The oldest known record comes from Plimpton 322, a Babylonian clay tablet from about 1800 BC, written in a sexagesimal number system. It was discovered by Edgar James Banks shortly after 1900, and sold to George Arthur Plimpton in 1922, for $10.[2]\n\nWhen searching for integer solutions, the equation a2 + b2 = c2 is a Diophantine equation. Thus Pythagorean triples are among the oldest known solutions of a nonlinear Diophantine equation.\n\n"

            "text": "Euclid's formula[3] is a fundamental formula for generating Pythagorean triples given an arbitrary pair of integers m and n with m > n > 0. The formula states that the integers\n\nform a Pythagorean triple. The triple generated by Euclid's formula is primitive if and only if m and n are coprime and one of them is even.  When both m and n are odd, then a, b, and c will be even, and the triple will not be primitive; however, dividing a, b, and c by 2 will yield a primitive triple when m and n are coprime.[4]\n\nEvery primitive triple arises (after the exchange of a and b, if a is even) from a unique pair of coprime numbers m, n, one of which is even. It follows that there are infinitely many primitive Pythagorean triples. This relationship of a, b and c to m and n from Euclid's formula is referenced throughout the rest of this article.\n\nDespite generating all primitive triples, Euclid's formula does not produce all triples—for example, (9, 12, 15) cannot be generated using integer m and n. This can be remedied by inserting an additional parameter k to the formula. The following will generate all Pythagorean triples uniquely:\n\nwhere m, n, and k are positive integers with m > n, and with m and n coprime and not both odd.\n\nThat these formulas generate Pythagorean triples can be verified by expanding a2 + b2 using elementary algebra and verifying that the result equals c2. Since every Pythagorean triple can be divided through by some integer k to obtain a primitive triple, every triple can be generated uniquely by using the formula with m and n to generate its primitive counterpart and then multiplying through by k as in the last equation.\n\nChoosing m and n from certain integer sequences gives interesting results. For example, if m and n are consecutive Pell numbers, a and b will differ by 1.[5]\n\nMany formulas for generating triples with particular properties have been developed since the time of Euclid.\n\nThat satisfaction of Euclid's formula by a, b, c is sufficient for the triangle to be Pythagorean is apparent from the fact that for positive integers m and n, m > n, the a, b, and c given by the formula are all positive integers, and from the fact that\n\nA proof of the necessity that a, b, c be expressed by Euclid's formula for any primitive Pythagorean triple is as follows.[6] All such primitive triples can be written as (a, b, c) where a2 + b2 = c2 and a, b, c are coprime. Thus a, b, c are pairwise coprime (if a prime number divided two of them, it would be forced also to divide the third one). As a and b are coprime, at least one of them is odd, so we may suppose that a is odd, by exchanging, if needed, a and b. This implies that b is even and c is odd (if b were odd, c would be even, and c2 would be a multiple of 4, while a2 + b2 would be congruent to 2 modulo 4, as an odd square is congruent to 1 modulo 4).\n\nFrom \n\n\n\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nb\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}\n\n we obtain \n\n\n\n\nc\n\n2\n\n\n−\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n=\n\nb\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle c^{2}-a^{2}=b^{2}}\n\n and hence \n\n\n\n(\nc\n−\na\n)\n(\nc\n+\na\n)\n=\n\nb\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (c-a)(c+a)=b^{2}}\n\n.

Since 4 would be the minimum possible even factor in the numerator and 2 would be the maximum possible even factor in the denominator, this would imply a to be even despite defining it as odd. Thus one of m and n is odd and the other is even, and the numerators of the two fractions with denominator 2mn are odd. Thus these fractions are fully reduced (an odd prime dividing this denominator divides one of m and n but not the other; thus it does not divide m2 ± n2). One may thus equate numerators with numerators and denominators with denominators, giving Euclid's formula \n\nA longer but more commonplace proof is given in Maor (2007)[7] and Sierpiński (2003).[8] Another proof is given in Diophantine equation § Example of Pythagorean triples, as an instance of a general method that applies to every homogeneous Diophantine equation of degree two.\n\nSuppose the sides of a Pythagorean triangle have lengths m2 − n2, 2mn, and m2 + n2, and suppose the angle between the leg of length m2 − n2 and the hypotenuse of length m2 + n2 is denoted as β.

            "text": "Alternatively, Euclid's formulae can be analyzed and proved using the Gaussian integers.[32] Gaussian integers are complex numbers of the form α = u + vi, where u and v are ordinary integers and i is the square root of negative one. The units of Gaussian integers are ±1 and ±i. The ordinary integers are called the rational integers and denoted as 'Z'. The Gaussian integers are denoted as Z[i]. The right-hand side of the Pythagorean theorem may be factored in Gaussian integers:\n\nA primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which a and b are coprime, i.e., they share no prime factors in the integers. For such a triple, either a or b is even, and the other is odd; from this, it follows that c is also odd.\n\nThe two factors z := a + bi and z* := a − bi of a primitive Pythagorean triple each equal the square of a Gaussian integer. This can be proved using the property that every Gaussian integer can be factored uniquely into Gaussian primes up to units.[33] (This unique factorization follows from the fact that, roughly speaking, a version of the Euclidean algorithm can be defined on them.) The proof has three steps. First, if a and b share no prime factors in the integers, then they also share no prime factors in the Gaussian integers. (Assume a = gu and b = gv with Gaussian integers g, u and v and g not a unit. Then u and v lie on the same line through the origin. All Gaussian integers on such a line are integer multiples of some Gaussian integer h. But then the integer gh ≠ ±1 divides both a and b.) Second, it follows that z and z* likewise share no prime factors in the Gaussian integers. For if they did, then their common divisor δ would also divide z + z* = 2a and z − z* = 2ib. Since a and b are coprime, that implies that δ divides 2 = (1 + i)(1 − i) = i(1 − i)2. From the formula c2 = zz*, that in turn would imply that c is even, contrary to the hypothesis of a primitive Pythagorean triple. Third, since c2 is a square, every Gaussian prime in its factorization is doubled, i.e., appears an even number of times. Since z and z* share no prime factors, this doubling is also true for them. Hence, z and z* are squares.\n\nThus, the first factor can be written\n\nThe real and imaginary parts of this equation give the two formulas:\n\nFor any primitive Pythagorean triple, there must be integers m and n such that these two equations are satisfied. Hence, every Pythagorean triple can be generated from some choice of these integers.\n\nIf we consider the square of a Gaussian integer we get the following direct interpretation of Euclid's formula as representing the perfect square of a Gaussian integer.\n\nUsing the facts that the Gaussian integers are a Euclidean domain and that for a Gaussian integer p \n\n\n\n\n|\n\np\n\n\n|\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |p|^{2}}\n\n is always a square it is possible to show that a Pythagorean triple corresponds to the square of a prime Gaussian integer if the hypotenuse is prime.\n\nIf the Gaussian integer is not prime then it is the product of two Gaussian integers p and q with \n\n\n\n\n|\n\np\n\n\n|\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |p|^{2}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\n|\n\nq\n\n\n|\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |q|^{2}}\n\n integers.

            "title": "Distribution of triples",
            "text": "There are a number of results on the distribution of Pythagorean triples. In the scatter plot, a number of obvious patterns are already apparent. Whenever the legs (a,b) of a primitive triple appear in the plot, all integer multiples of (a,b) must also appear in the plot, and this property produces the appearance of lines radiating from the origin in the diagram.\n\nWithin the scatter, there are sets of parabolic patterns with a high density of points and all their foci at the origin, opening up in all four directions. Different parabolas intersect at the axes and appear to reflect off the axis with an incidence angle of 45 degrees, with a third parabola entering in a perpendicular fashion. Within this quadrant, each arc centered on the origin shows that section of the parabola that lies between its tip and its intersection with its semi-latus rectum.\n\nThese patterns can be explained as follows. If \n\n\n\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n\n/\n\n4\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle a^{2}/4n}\n\n is an integer, then (a, \n\n\n\n\n|\n\nn\n−\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n\n/\n\n4\nn\n\n|\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle |n-a^{2}/4n|}\n\n, \n\n\n\nn\n+\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n\n/\n\n4\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n+a^{2}/4n}\n\n) is a Pythagorean triple. (In fact every Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) can be written in this way with integer n, possibly after exchanging a and b, since \n\n\n\nn\n=\n(\nb\n+\nc\n)\n\n/\n\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n=(b+c)/2}\n\n and a and b cannot both be odd.) The Pythagorean triples thus lie on curves given by \n\n\n\nb\n=\n\n|\n\nn\n−\n\na\n\n2\n\n\n\n/\n\n4\nn\n\n|\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle b=|n-a^{2}/4n|}\n\n, that is, parabolas reflected at the a-axis, and the corresponding curves with a and b interchanged. If a is varied for a given n (i.e. on a given parabola), integer values of b occur relatively frequently if n is a square or a small multiple of a square. If several such values happen to lie close together, the corresponding parabolas approximately coincide, and the triples cluster in a narrow parabolic strip. For instance, 382 = 1444, 2 × 272 = 1458,\n3 × 222 = 1452, 5 × 172 = 1445 and 10 × 122 = 1440; the corresponding parabolic strip around n ≈ 1450 is clearly visible in the scatter plot.\n\nThe angular properties described above follow immediately from the functional form of the parabolas. The parabolas are reflected at the a-axis at a = 2n, and the derivative of b with respect to a at this point is –1; hence the incidence angle is 45°. Since the clusters, like all triples, are repeated at integer multiples, the value 2n also corresponds to a cluster. The corresponding parabola intersects the b-axis at right angles at b = 2n, and hence its reflection upon interchange of a and b intersects the a-axis at right angles at a = 2n, precisely where the parabola for n is reflected at the a-axis. (The same is of course true for a and b interchanged.)\n\nAlbert Fässler and others provide insights into the significance of these parabolas in the context of conformal mappings.[34][35]\n\n"

If a is replaced with the fraction m/n in the sequence, the result is equal to the 'standard' triple generator (2mn, m2 − n2,m2 + n2) after rescaling. It follows that every triple has a corresponding rational a value which can be used to generate a similar triangle (one with the same three angles and with sides in the same proportions as the original).  For example, the Platonic equivalent of (56, 33, 65) is generated by a = m/n = 7/4 as (a, (a2 –1)/2, (a2+1)/2) = (56/32, 33/32, 65/32).

The Pythagorean n-tuple can be made primitive by dividing out by the largest common divisor of its values.\n\nFurthermore, any primitive Pythagorean n-tuple a21 + ... + a2n = c2 can be found by this approach.  Use (m1, ..., mn) = (c + a1, a2, ..., an) to get a Pythagorean n-tuple by the above formula and divide out by the largest common integer divisor, which is 2m1 = 2(c + a1).  Dividing out by the largest common divisor of these (m1, ..., mn) values gives the same primitive Pythagorean n-tuple; and there is a one-to-one correspondence between tuples of setwise coprime positive integers (m1, ..., mn) satisfying m21 > m22 + ... + m2n and primitive Pythagorean n-tuples.\n\nExamples of the relationship between setwise coprime values \n\n\n\n\n\n\nm\n→\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\vec {m}}}\n\n and primitive Pythagorean n-tuples include:[40]\n\nSince the sum F(k,m) of k consecutive squares beginning with m2 is given by the formula,[41]\n\none may find values (k, m) so that F(k,m) is a square, such as one by Hirschhorn where the number of terms is itself a square,[42]\n\nand v ≥ 5 is any integer not divisible by 2 or 3. For the smallest case v = 5, hence k = 25, this yields the well-known cannonball-stacking problem of Lucas,\n\na fact which is connected to the Leech lattice.\n\nIn addition, if in a Pythagorean n-tuple (n ≥ 4) all addends are consecutive except one, one can use the equation,[43]\n\nSince the second power of p cancels out, this is only linear and easily solved for as \n\n\n\np\n=\n\n\n\n\nF\n(\nk\n,\nm\n)\n−\n1\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle p={\\tfrac {F(k,m)-1}{2}}}\n\n though k, m should be chosen so that p is an integer,  with a small example being k = 5, m = 1 yielding,\n\nThus, one way of generating Pythagorean n-tuples is by using, for various x,[44]\n\nwhere q = n–2 and where\n\nA generalization of the concept of Pythagorean triples is the search for triples of positive integers a, b, and c, such that an + bn = cn, for some n strictly greater than 2. Pierre de Fermat in 1637 claimed that no such triple exists, a claim that came to be known as Fermat's Last Theorem because it took longer than any other conjecture by Fermat to be proved or disproved. The first proof was given by Andrew Wiles in 1994.\n\nAnother generalization is searching for sequences of n + 1 positive integers for which the nth power of the last is the sum of the nth powers of the previous terms. The smallest sequences for known values of n are:\n\nFor the n = 3 case, in which \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n3\n\n\n+\n\ny\n\n3\n\n\n+\n\nz\n\n3\n\n\n=\n\nw\n\n3\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x^{3}+y^{3}+z^{3}=w^{3},}\n\n called the  Fermat cubic, a general formula exists giving all solutions.\n\nA slightly different generalization allows the sum of (k + 1) nth powers to equal the sum of (n − k) nth powers. For example:\n\nThere can also exist n − 1 positive integers whose nth powers sum to an nth power (though, by Fermat's Last Theorem, not for n = 3); these are counterexamples to Euler's sum of powers conjecture.  The smallest known counterexamples are[45][46][15]\n\nA Heronian triangle is commonly defined as one with integer sides whose area is also an integer. The lengths of the sides of such a triangle form a Heronian triple (a, b, c) for a ≤ b ≤ c.\nEvery Pythagorean triple is a Heronian triple, because at least one of the legs a, b must be even in a Pythagorean triple, so the area ab/2 is an integer. Not every Heronian triple is a Pythagorean triple, however, as the example (4, 13, 15) with area 24 shows.\n\nIf (a, b, c) is a Heronian triple, so is (ka, kb, kc) where k is any positive integer; its area will be the integer that is k2 times the integer area of the (a, b, c) triangle.\nThe Heronian triple (a, b, c) is primitive provided a, b, c are setwise coprime.  (With primitive Pythagorean triples the stronger statement that they are pairwise coprime also applies, but with primitive Heronian triangles the stronger statement does not always hold true, such as with (7, 15, 20).) Here are a few of the simplest primitive Heronian triples that are not Pythagorean triples:\n\nBy Heron's formula, the extra condition for a triple of positive integers (a, b, c) with a < b < c to be Heronian is that\n\nor equivalently\n\nbe a nonzero perfect square divisible by 16.\n\nPrimitive Pythagorean triples have been used in cryptography as random sequences and for the generation of keys.[47]\n\n"
