            "text": "Longus, sometimes Longos (Greek: Λόγγος), was the author of an ancient Greek novel or romance, Daphnis and Chloe.  Nothing is known of his life; it is assumed that he lived on the isle of Lesbos (setting for Daphnis and Chloe) during the 2nd century AD.\n\nIt has been suggested that the name Longus is merely a misinterpretation of the first word of Daphnis and Chloe's title Λεσβιακῶν ἐρωτικῶν λόγοι (\"story of a Lesbian romance\", \"Lesbian\" for \"from Lesbos island\") in the Florentine manuscript; EE Seiler observes that the best manuscript begins and ends with λόγου (not λόγγου) ποιμενικῶν.[1][2]\n\nIf his name was really Longus, he was possibly a freedman of some Roman family which bore that name as a cognomen.\n\n"
