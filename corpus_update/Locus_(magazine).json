It is the news organ and trade journal for the English-language science fiction and fantasy fields.[1] It also publishes comprehensive listings of all new books published in the genres (excluding self-published).[2] The magazine also presents the annual Locus Awards.

Brown, Ed Meskys, and Dave Vanderwerf founded Locus in 1968 as a news fanzine to promote the (ultimately successful) bid to host the 1971 World Science Fiction Convention in Boston, Massachusetts. Originally intended to run only until the site-selection vote was taken at St. Louiscon, the 1969 Worldcon in St. Louis, Missouri, Brown decided to continue publishing Locus as a mimeographed general science fiction and fantasy newszine. Locus succeeded the monthly newszine Science Fiction Times (formerly Fantasy Times, founded 1941), when SFT ceased publication in 1970. Brown directed Locus as publisher and editor-in-chief for more than 40 years, from 1968 until his death at age 72 in July 2009.[1][3]\n\nLocus announced that the magazine would continue operations, with then executive editor Liza Groen Trombi succeeding Brown as editor-in-chief in 2009.[4] The magazine is now owned by the Locus Science Fiction Foundation, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation.[5]\n\nLocus publishes:[3][6][7]\n\n"

It publishes news briefs related to the science fiction, fantasy and horror publishing world, along with original reviews and feature articles, and excerpts of articles that appeared in the print edition.[3] Information for Locus Online is compiled and edited by Mark R. Kelly.[11]  In 2002, Locus Online won the first Hugo Award for Best Web Site.[12]  It was nominated again in 2005.[13]\nIn January 2016, longtime short-fiction reviewer Lois Tilton announced her resignation. She wrote, \"Without consulting or informing me, they had begun deleting material they considered negative from my reviews. To me, this is censorship and completely unacceptable.\"[14] It was later clarified by Locus that the edits were not intended to be made to work already published, but rather going forward, to future reviews. None of her past columns were changed, she was paid for the unpublished work, and the relationship ended amicably.[15]\n\n"

As of 2012[update], Locus won the award for \"Best Fanzine\" eight times and for \"Best Semiprozine\" 22 times during the category's first 29 years. In 2012 \"Best Semiprozine\" was redefined to exclude all small, independent genre magazines as \"professional publications\" if they had either \"(1) provided at least a quarter the income of any one person or, (2) was owned or published by any entity which provided at least a quarter the income of any of its staff and/or owner.\"; this included Locus.[22] There is no longer a \"Professional Magazine\" Hugo Award; that original category was replaced in 1973 by the current \"Best Editor.\"[3][23]\n\n"
