Under the tutelage of Julian Besag, he began to gain an interest in statistics.[4]\n\nHe matriculated at the University of Oxford and in 1973, gained his masters in statistics, by thesis \"Contagion and Allied Processes\" (M.Sc., 1973). After completion of his masters, Diggle enrolled in a PhD programme at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where he gained his doctorate in 1977 in statistics by thesis, with the research topic \"Spatial Processes with Applications in Ecology\".[5]\n\n"

While at Newcastle, he went under Robin Plackett’s wing, who's obituary he wrote.[5]\n\nSpatial statistics was still a relatively new field in the 70s. Peter took part in organising conferences for this field. Virtually everyone in the country who worked in spatial statistics (between 30 – 50 people) would attend these conferences in Newcastle.[5]\n\nHe worked in the CSIRO division for Mathematics and Statistics in Australia. He started as a senior research scientist from 1985 – 1986. Then, from 1986 – 1987, he became a chief research scientist until his promotion to Chief of Division from 1987 – 1988. From 1988 – 2007, he became a professor of statistics at Lancaster University.[5]\n\n"
