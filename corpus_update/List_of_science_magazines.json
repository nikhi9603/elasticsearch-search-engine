In contrast, a periodical publication, usually including primary research and/or reviews, that is written by scientific experts is called a \"scientific journal\". Science magazines are read by non-scientists and scientists who want accessible information on fields outside their specialization.\n\nArticles in science magazines are sometimes republished or summarized by the general press.\n\n"
