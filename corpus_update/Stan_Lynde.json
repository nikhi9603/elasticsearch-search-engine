            "text": "Born 23 September 1931 in Billings, Montana, he was raised on a sheep ranch near Lodge Grass. He attended the University of Montana in Missoula where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and later lived in Helena.\n\nIn 1958, Lynde created the comic strip Rick O'Shay, a critical and commercial success. Like most of his work, it was set in the West and mixed humor with strong storytelling. After a dispute with the syndicate, Lynde left the strip in 1977. The strip continued, drawn by Alfredo Alcala.[2]\n\nIn 1979, Lynde launched another strip, Latigo, starring Cole \"Latigo\" Cantrell, a.k.a. \"Two Trails\". His father was a mountain man and his mother a Crow Indian. After serving in the Union Army during the Civil War, Latigo returned to the West and became a federal marshal. The daily strip was launched on 25 June 1979, joined by a Sunday strip, best seen in the half page format, on 1 July 1979. It was not a great commercial success and ended in 1983, the daily on 7 May, the Sunday on 5 June.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1985, Lynde produced the weekly panel Grass Roots, which was revived in 1998. In the late 1980s, the Swedish financial newspaper Dagens Industri commissioned a comic strip from Lynde. It became \"Chief Plenty Bucks\", set in the West and starring a capitalistic Native American chief. Lynde drew ten pages, but the project was shelved and never published in Dagens Industri. In 1997, the strip was revived for the Swedish Fantomen magazine (and its Norwegian and Finnish counterparts). The title was changed to Chief Sly Fox and a total of 86 pages (including the originals from the 1980s) were published from 1997 to 2000. They have never been published in English.[3]\n\nIn 2002, Lynde returned with another exclusive comic for Fantomen; Bad Bob about a hopeless Wild West criminal. This strip is still running in reprint.\n\nIn December 2012, Lynde announced relocating to Ecuador.[4] He quoted Charles Marion Russell in his last blog post stating of his time: Just a little sunshine, just a little rain. Just a little pleasure, just a little pain. After moving to Ecuador, Lynde fell ill but initially believed he had bronchitis. In May 2013 it was discovered to be a form of lung cancer and he moved back to Helena MT where he died at age 81 on 6 August 2013.[5]\n\n"
