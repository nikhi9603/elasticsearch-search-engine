            "text": "The Alexander Romance is an account of the life and exploits of Alexander the Great. Although constructed around a historical core, the romance is mostly fictional. It was widely copied and translated, accruing various legends and fantastical elements at different stages. The original version was composed in Ancient Greek some time before 338 CE, when a Latin translation was made, although the exact date is unknown. Several late manuscripts attribute the work to Alexander's court historian Callisthenes, but Callisthenes died before Alexander and therefore could not have written a full account of his life. The unknown author is still sometimes known as Pseudo-Callisthenes.\n\nBetween the 4th and the 16th centuries, the Alexander Romance was translated into Coptic, Ge'ez, Byzantine Greek, Arabic, Persian, Armenian, Syriac, Hebrew, and most medieval European vernaculars. The romance was also put into verse, as in a Byzantine recension of 1388. Owing to the great variety of distinct works derived from the original Greek romance, the \"Alexander Romance\" is sometimes treated as a literary genre and not a single work.[1]\n\n"

            "text": "Alexander was a legend during his own time. In a now-lost history of the king, the historical Callisthenes described the sea in Cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis. Writing after Alexander's death, the historian and philosopher Onesicritus invented a tryst between Alexander and Thalestris, queen of the mythical Amazons. (Onesicritus was widely criticized even in his own time for his inaccuracies; according to Plutarch, when Onesicritus read the relevant passage to his patron Lysimachus, one of Alexander's generals who later became a king himself, Lysimachus quipped, \"I wonder where I was at the time.\"[2])\n\nThroughout classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, the Romance experienced numerous expansions and revisions exhibiting a variability unknown for more formal literary forms. Latin, Armenian, Georgian, and Syriac translations were produced in Late Antiquity (4th to 6th centuries).\n\nThe Latin Alexandreis of Walter of Châtillon was one of the most popular medieval romances. A 10th-century Latin version by one Leo the Archpriest is the basis of the later medieval vernacular translations in all the major languages of Europe, including Old French (12th century), Middle English, Early Scots (The Buik of Alexander, 13th century), Italian, Spanish (the Libro de Alexandre), Central German (Lamprecht's Alexanderlied, and a 15th-century version by Johannes Hartlieb), Slavonic,[citation needed] Romanian,[citation needed] Hungarian and Irish.[3]\n\nThe Syriac version generated Middle Eastern recensions, including versions in Arabic, Persian (Iskandarnamah), Ethiopic, Hebrew (in the first part of Sefer HaAggadah), Ottoman Turkish[4] (14th century), and Middle Mongolian[5] (13th-14th century). In addition to the Alexander Romance of Pseudo-Callisthenes, the Syriac version also includes a short appendix now known as the Syriac Alexander Legend.[6] This original Syriac text was written in north Mesopotamia around 629-630 CE, shortly after Heraclius defeated the Persians.[7] It contains additional motifs not found in the earliest Greek version of the Romance, including the episode where Alexander builds a wall against Gog and Magog.[6]\n\n"

It was subjected to various revisions during the Byzantine Empire, some of them recasting it into poetical form in Medieval Greek vernacular. Recensio α is the source of a Latin version by Julius Valerius Alexander Polemius (4th century), as well as an Armenian version (5th century). Most of the content of the Romance is fantastical, including many miraculous tales and encounters with mythical creatures such as sirens or centaurs.\n\n"

There are five major romances in Middle English which have been passed down to us and most remain only in fragments. There are also two versions from Scotland, one which has sometimes been ascribed to the Early Scots poet John Barbour, which exists only in a sixteenth-century printing, and a Middle Scots version from 1499: \n\n"

            "text": "The Syriac version of the Alexander Romance is preserved in five manuscripts, the oldest of which was compiled in 1708-09.[7] It is largely based on the Greek Pseudo-Callisthenes version, with slight modifications, such as the addition of Alexander's journey to China.[7]\n\nIn Syriac literature in particular, there are other works originally written in Syriac that are often attached to the Alexander Romance manuscripts. These works include the Syriac Legend of Alexander, the composition of which is commonly attributed to north Mesopotamia around 629-630 CE, shortly after Heraclius defeated the Persians.[7] However, some have argued that the Syriac recension was originally produced in an earlier form in the early 6th century and was updated in the early 7th century in light of then-contemporary apocalyptic themes.[10] Another position taken up by some scholars is that the text was composed around the Byzantine-Sassanid events surrounding the year 614.[11] The Syriac Legend contains additional motifs not found in the earliest Greek Romance, including the episode where Alexander builds a wall against Gog and Magog.[6] There is also a poem (often wrongly attributed to Jacob of Serugh) based on the Syriac Legend but written slightly later. Finally, there is a shorter version of the Legend and an original brief biography of Alexander.[7]\n\nThe Syriac Alexander Legend has been found to closely resemble the story of Dhu al-Qarnayn in the Qur'an.\n\n"
