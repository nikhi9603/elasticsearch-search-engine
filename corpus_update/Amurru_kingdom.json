            "text": "Amurru was an Amorite kingdom established c. 2000 BC,[1] in a region spanning present-day western and north-western Syria and northern Lebanon.[2][3][4] The inhabitants spoke the Amorite language, an extinct early Northwest Semitic language language classified as a westernmost or Amorite-specific dialect of Ugaritic.[5][6][7] The kingdom and its people were synonymous with their god Amurru, also known as Martu, a storm and weather deity and patron god of the unknown Mesopotamian city of Ninab, titled as bêl šadê and sometimes compared to the Canaanite and Mesopotamian god Hadad/Iškur.[8][9]\n\nThe first documented leader of Amurru was Abdi-Ashirta (14th century BC), under whose leadership Amurru was part of the Egyptian empire. His son Aziru made contact with the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I, and eventually defected to the Hittites.\n\nThe capital of the Amurru kingdom was the city of Sumur (located in the modern-day southern coast of Syria), a Phoenician city conquered by Abdi-Ashirta.\n\nThe Amurru kingdom was destroyed around 1200 B.C.\n\n"
