            "text": "Space advertising is advertising in outer space. There have been several proposals to advertise in space, including the launch of billboards that would be visible from Earth. Space advertising may be obtrusive or non-obtrusive. \n\nObtrusive space advertising is the term used for ads in space that can be recognized (e.g. skywriting) by people without supporting devices such as telescopes or binoculars.[1][2] Non-obtrusive space advertising is the opposite. Logos on space suits, satellites, and rockets are examples of non-obtrusive space advertising.[1]\n\nAdvertising in space can cause space debris, as well as obscuring the view of space as seen from the ground. This form of advertising is regulated by international and national legislation. As technology improves, further regulations will be required to address and encompass new forms of space advertising. While space advertising is limited by both contemporary regulation and technological capability, in popular culture, space advertising has taken a variety of forms and displays.\n\n"

            "text": "After the Space Race and the fall of the Soviet Union,[3] space advertising became a point of interest for various organizations. There have been numerous attempts at space advertising since then, such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX launch of a Tesla car into orbit.[4][5]\n\nA major advantage of space advertising over other Earth-bound methods is the sheer scale of reach. Millions of people across multiple countries can be exposed to an advert orbiting Earth. As such, space advertising can provide valuable advertising capabilities, though relatively high start-up costs have prohibited this from becoming a commonplace mode of advertisement.[6][7]\n\n"

            "text": "The high cost of orbital spaceflight (millions per launch) has discouraged attempts in the past.[8] Public space exploration authorities have also been reluctant to cater to advertisers. For example, NASA's restrictive policy on its employees' endorsing of products required astronauts to refer to M&M's as \"candy-coated\" chocolates.[9][10]\n\nDue to the high cost of orbital launches as well as the associated maintenance costs, there have not been many successful advertising projects. For context, SpaceX's base fares for sending objects into space are in the millions.[11][12]\n\nSome of the successful attempts include:\n\nAlthough the number of attempts at space advertising is small, there have been several notable failed attempts as companies and organizations around the world planned different projects to launch some type of marketing ploy into space.\n\nSome of the failed attempts that have occurred in the past include:\n\n"

            "title": "Challenges",
            "text": "One of the challenges of obtrusive space advertising is the difference in marketing regulations across different countries. Because obtrusive space advertisements orbit the earth, they are seen in the sky in multiple different countries. In the EU, advertisers are banned from running tobacco related advertisements. In Ireland, advertisements that undermine public authority are also outlawed. (Bunreacht na hÉireann, 1937, Art. 40.6.1). Countries like the United States on the other hand prioritize freedom of commercial speech. These differences in advertising regulations make it harder for obtrusive space advertisements to remain legal across multiple jurisdictions.[1]\n\nIn the United States, consumers have the right to deny the receipt of advertisement. It is not clear whether or not consumers can effectively opt out of receiving space advertisements. Consumers might have to close their blinds, doors, or not look into the sky to not view space advertisements.[1]\n\nInfringements on property rights also create a challenge for space advertisers. Since space advertisements could be bright lit, it might create nuisance for property owners. Bright objects in the sky might interfere with sleep cycles for some property owners.[1]\n\nThe International Astronomical Union argues that artificial satellites built out of reflective material adversely impact astronomical observations.[29] Obtrusive space advertisements that are comparable to the brightness of the moon have the potential to make the observation of faint distant objects impossible from the surface of the earth.\n\nAnything that is launched into orbit generally remains in orbit. Space objects that have surpassed their functional use period not equipped with deorbiting technology are considered space debris. Space debris can lead to collisions with other space objects which can contribute to a cascading increase in space debris known as the Kessler syndrome. Increasing amounts of space debris can make space exploration and utilization of LEO more difficult.[30]\n\nSpace advertisers could face penalties if the advertisements are considered to eventually become space debris. Because objects in orbit can remain in orbit for long periods of time, it is possible that the object remains in orbit longer than the advertising entity still exists. If approved, obtrusive space advertisers can expect to comply with end-of-life deorbiting measures and anti-collision measures.[30]\n\n"

            "title": "Criticism",
            "text": "There is also growing concern about the dangers that can be caused by launching more objects - including advertisements - in space.  Placing more satellites in space could increase opportunities for satellite collisions, as stated by John Crassidis, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University at Buffalo.  He believes that the biggest issue will be how the additional satellites can potentially become space debris.[45]  An implication of the additional advertising satellites in space could contribute to the Kessler syndrome. Many other incidents of space collisions have occurred:\n\nAside from the danger that can be brought about with increasing space advertising, pollution is also another problem. A paper that was presented to the United Nations by International Astronomical Union stated that \"Scattered light from sunlit spacecraft and space debris, and radio noise from communications satellites and global positioning systems in space, reach the entire surface of the Earth”.[47] Furthermore, there is currently no international consensus on the best way to remove the space debris since space in the international territory and so the increase in space debris will also make space even more impenetrable because of the increased likelihood of collision which can deter future space missions.[48]\n\n"
