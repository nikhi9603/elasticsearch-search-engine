            "text": "Peptides (from Ancient Greek  πεπτός (peptós) 'digested', from  πέσσειν (péssein) 'to digest') are short chains of amino acids linked by peptide bonds.[1][2] Long chains of amino acids are called proteins. Chains of fewer than twenty amino acids are called oligopeptides, and include dipeptides, tripeptides, and tetrapeptides.\n\nA polypeptide is a longer, continuous, unbranched peptide chain.[3] Hence, peptides fall under the broad chemical classes of biological polymers and oligomers, alongside nucleic acids, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and others.\n\nA polypeptide that contains more than approximately 50 amino acids is known as a protein.[3][4][5] Proteins consist of one or more polypeptides arranged in a biologically functional way, often bound to ligands such as coenzymes and cofactors, or to another protein or other macromolecule such as DNA or RNA, or to complex macromolecular assemblies.[6]\n\nAmino acids that have been incorporated into peptides are termed residues. A water molecule is released during formation of each amide bond.[7] All peptides except cyclic peptides have an N-terminal (amine group) and C-terminal (carboxyl group) residue at the end of the peptide (as shown for the tetrapeptide in the image).\n\n"

            "text": "There are numerous types of peptides that have been classified according to their sources and functions. According to the Handbook of Biologically Active Peptides, some groups of peptides include plant peptides, bacterial/antibiotic peptides, fungal peptides, invertebrate peptides, amphibian/skin peptides, venom peptides, cancer/anticancer peptides, vaccine peptides, immune/inflammatory peptides, brain peptides, endocrine peptides, ingestive peptides, gastrointestinal peptides, cardiovascular peptides, renal peptides, respiratory peptides, opiate peptides, neurotrophic peptides, and blood–brain peptides.[8]\n\nSome ribosomal peptides are subject to proteolysis. These function, typically in higher organisms, as hormones and signaling molecules. Some microbes produce peptides as antibiotics, such as microcins and bacteriocins.[9]\n\nPeptides frequently have post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, hydroxylation, sulfonation, palmitoylation, glycosylation, and disulfide formation. In general, peptides are linear, although lariat structures have been observed.[10] More exotic manipulations do occur, such as racemization of L-amino acids to D-amino acids in platypus venom.[11]\n\nNonribosomal peptides are assembled by enzymes, not the ribosome. A common non-ribosomal peptide is glutathione, a component of the antioxidant defenses of most aerobic organisms.[12] Other nonribosomal peptides are most common in unicellular organisms, plants, and fungi and are synthesized by modular enzyme complexes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases.[13]\n\nThese complexes are often laid out in a similar fashion, and they can contain many different modules to perform a diverse set of chemical manipulations on the developing product.[14] These peptides are often cyclic and can have highly complex cyclic structures, although linear nonribosomal peptides are also common. Since the system is closely related to the machinery for building fatty acids and polyketides, hybrid compounds are often found. The presence of oxazoles or thiazoles often indicates that the compound was synthesized in this fashion.[15]\n\nPeptones are derived from animal milk or meat digested by proteolysis.[16] In addition to containing small peptides, the resulting material includes fats, metals, salts, vitamins, and many other biological compounds. Peptones are used in nutrient media for growing bacteria and fungi.[17]\n\nPeptide fragments refer to fragments of proteins that are used to identify or quantify the source protein.[18] Often these are the products of enzymatic degradation performed in the laboratory on a controlled sample, but can also be forensic or paleontological samples that have been degraded by natural effects.[19][20]\n\n"

            "title": "Example families",
            "text": "The peptide families in this section are ribosomal peptides, usually with hormonal activity. All of these peptides are synthesized by cells as longer \"propeptides\" or \"proproteins\" and truncated prior to exiting the cell. They are released into the bloodstream where they perform their signaling functions.\n\n"

        {
            "title": "Terminology",
            "text": "Several terms related to peptides have no strict length definitions, and there is often overlap in their usage:\n\nPeptides of defined length are named using IUPAC numerical multiplier prefixes:\n\nThe same words are also used to describe a group of residues in a larger polypeptide (e.g., RGD motif).\n\n"
