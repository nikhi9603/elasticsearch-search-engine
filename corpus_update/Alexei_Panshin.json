            "text": "Panshin was the author of the Anthony Villiers series made up of Star Well, The Thurb Revolution, and Masque World. A fourth volume entitled The Universal Pantograph,[5] never appeared, reputedly because of conflicts between the writer and his publisher. Of the Villiers series, noted SF writer Samuel R. Delany writes in the foreword of Star Well:\n\nNew Celebrations, an omnibus volume collecting the first three volumes, has appeared.\n\nPanshin wrote a novel, Earth Magic with his wife, Cory Panshin. His works also include a short story collection, Farewell To Yesterday's Tomorrow.\n\n"

            "text": "Panshin published a study of the prominent American science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein, Heinlein in Dimension.[6][1]\n\nMost of this work was originally published in fanzines, for which Panshin won the Best Fan Writer Hugo award in 1967. The writings were then published in book form by Advent. Panshin discusses reactions to this work on his website The Abyss of Wonder.[7]\n\nPanshin's general critical work SF in Dimension (1976) was also co-written with Cory Panshin, as was his lengthy theoretical-critical The World Beyond The Hill: Science Fiction and the Quest for Transcendence (1989), which received a Hugo Award for Best Related Work. A number of Alexei Panshin's books (including The World Beyond the Hill) are being republished by Phoenix Pick, an imprint of Arc Manor Publishers.\n\n"
