            "text": "Population dynamics has traditionally been the dominant branch of mathematical biology, which has a history of more than 220 years,[1] although over the last century the scope of mathematical biology has greatly expanded.\n\nThe beginning of population dynamics is widely regarded as the work of Malthus, formulated as the Malthusian growth model. According to Malthus, assuming that the conditions (the environment) remain constant (ceteris paribus), a population will grow (or decline) exponentially.[2]: 18  This principle provided the basis for the subsequent predictive theories, such as the demographic studies such as the work of Benjamin Gompertz[3] and Pierre François Verhulst in the early 19th century, who refined and adjusted the Malthusian demographic model.[4]\n\nA more general model formulation was proposed by F. J. Richards in 1959,[5] further expanded by Simon Hopkins, in which the models of Gompertz, Verhulst and also Ludwig von Bertalanffy are covered as special cases of the general formulation. The Lotka–Volterra predator-prey equations are another famous example,[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] as well as the alternative Arditi–Ginzburg equations.[14][15]\n\n"

            "text": "Simplified population models usually start with four key variables (four demographic processes) including death, birth, immigration, and emigration. Mathematical models used to calculate changes in population demographics and evolution hold the assumption ('null hypothesis') of no external influence. Models can be more mathematically complex where \"...several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with the data.\"[16] For example, in a closed system where immigration and emigration does not take place, the rate of change in the number of individuals in a population can be described as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nN\n\n\nd\nT\n\n\n\n=\nB\n−\nD\n=\nb\nN\n−\nd\nN\n=\n(\nb\n−\nd\n)\nN\n=\nr\nN\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {dN}{dT}}=B-D=bN-dN=(b-d)N=rN,}\n\n\nwhere N is the total number of individuals in the specific experimental population being studied, B is the number of births and D is the number of deaths per individual in a particular experiment or model. The algebraic symbols b, d and r stand for the rates of birth, death, and the rate of change per individual in the general population, the intrinsic rate of increase. This formula can be read as the rate of change in the population (dN/dT) is equal to births minus deaths (B − D).[2][13][17]\n\nUsing these techniques, Malthus' population principle of growth was later transformed into a mathematical model known as the logistic equation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\nN\n\n\nd\nT\n\n\n\n=\na\nN\n\n(\n\n1\n−\n\n\nN\nK\n\n\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {dN}{dT}}=aN\\left(1-{\\frac {N}{K}}\\right),}\n\n\nwhere N is the biomass density, a is the maximum per-capita rate of change, and K is the carrying capacity of the population. The formula can be read as follows: the rate of change in the population (dN/dT) is equal to growth (aN) that is limited by carrying capacity (1 − N/K). From these basic mathematical principles the discipline of population ecology expands into a field of investigation that queries the demographics of real populations and tests these results against the statistical models. The field of population ecology often uses data on life history and matrix algebra to develop projection matrices on fecundity and survivorship. This information is used for managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest quotas.[13][17]\n\n"

In logistic populations however, the intrinsic growth rate, also known as intrinsic rate of increase (r) is the relevant growth constant. Since generations of reproduction in a geometric population do not overlap (e.g. reproduce once a year) but do in an exponential population, geometric and exponential populations are usually considered to be mutually exclusive.[25] However, both sets of constants share the mathematical relationship below.[20]\n\nThe growth equation for exponential populations is \n\n\n\n\nN\n\nt\n\n\n=\n\nN\n\n0\n\n\n\ne\n\nr\nt\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle N_{t}=N_{0}e^{rt}}\n\n where e is Euler's number, a universal constant often applicable in logistic equations, and r is the intrinsic growth rate.\n\nTo find the relationship between a geometric population and a logistic population, we assume the Nt is the same for both models, and we expand to the following equality:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN\n\n0\n\n\n\ne\n\nr\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\nN\n\n0\n\n\n\nλ\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\nr\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\nλ\n\nt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr\nt\n\n\n\n=\nt\nln\n⁡\n(\nλ\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}N_{0}e^{rt}&=N_{0}\\lambda ^{t}\\\\e^{rt}&=\\lambda ^{t}\\\\rt&=t\\ln(\\lambda )\\end{aligned}}}\n\n\nGiving us \n\n\n\nr\n=\nln\n⁡\n(\nλ\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r=\\ln(\\lambda )}\n\n and \n\n\n\nλ\n=\n\ne\n\nr\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\lambda =e^{r}.}\n\n\n\n"
