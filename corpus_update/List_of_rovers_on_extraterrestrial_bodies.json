Rovers are used to explore, collect information, and take samples of the surface. This is a list of all rovers on extraterrestrial bodies in the Solar System. Since 1970, there have been four lunar rovers (excludes the three Lunar Roving Vehicles on Apollo 15, 16, and 17, as they carried no payloads and were designed to be driven by astronauts on the lunar surface), six Mars rovers, and three asteroid rovers that have successfully landed and explored these extraterrestrial surfaces.\n\n"
