Hegel (particularly in his concept of Weltgeist).\n\n"

            "text": "Plato adhered to this idea,[1] identifying the universe as a living being:\n\nPlato's Timaeus describes this living cosmos as being built by the demiurge[3] constructed as to be self-identical and intelligible to reason,[4] according to a rational pattern expressed in mathematical principles and Pythagorean ratios describing the structure of the cosmos, and particularly the motions of the seven classical planets.[5]\n\nFollowing Plato, the anima mundi became an important component in Neoplatonic cosmology, often including its close relationship to the demiurge and the seven planets.\n\nThe Stoics believed it to be the only vital force in the universe.\n\nThe anima mundi was borrowed from Platonist philosophy into several Gnostic sects.\n\nIn Manichaeism, the anima mundi was also called the Light Soul and the Living Soul (Middle Persian: grīw zīndag), contrasting it with matter, which was associated with lifelessness and death and within which the anima mundi was imprisoned.[6] The anima mundi was personified as the Suffering Jesus (Jesus patibilis) who, like the historical Jesus, was depicted as being crucified in the world.[7][8] This mystica cruxificio was present in all parts of the world, including the skies, soil, and trees, as expressed in the Coptic Manichaean psalms.[9]\n\nIn Mandaeism, the anima mundi has various parallels with mana.[citation needed][original research?]\n\nThe concept of the anima mundi is present in the works of hermetic philosophers like Paracelsus and Robert Fludd.\n\nIn Jewish mysticism, a parallel concept is that of Chokhmah Ila'ah, which is the all-encompassing Supernal Wisdom that transcends, orders, and vitalises all of creation. Rabbi Nachman of Breslov states that this sublime wisdom may be apprehended by a perfect tzaddik (righteous man).[10] Thus, the tzaddik attains cosmic consciousness and thus is empowered to mitigate all division and conflict within creation.\n\n"
