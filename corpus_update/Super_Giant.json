He is also known in Japan as Giant of Steel (鋼鉄の巨人, Kōtetsu no Kyojin), is known in The United States as Starman, and known in France and Italy as Spaceman.\n\n"

            "text": "Whereas Takeo Nagamatsu's 1930 kamishibai The Golden Bat (Ōgon Batto) was Japan's first modern superhero (and had many manga, anime and film adaptations), Shintoho's Super Giant was the first celluloid superhero (theatrically released in 1957), and the role model for many Japanese superheroes to come, especially Ultraman and Kamen Rider.[citation needed]\n\nNamed \"Super Giants\" (plural), although the main character was only one person and obviously human-sized, the series' title was no doubt inspired by the American Adventures of Superman (which was then being broadcast in Japan) and the famous Japanese baseball team, the Yomiuri Giants (who were extremely popular at the time).[1]\n\nMoonlight Mask (Gekkō Kamen) became Japan's first made-for-television superhero when his TV show debuted in 1958, but Super Giant was Japan's first theatrical superhero series.\n\n"

            "title": "Character background",
            "text": "Super Giant is a human-like being created from the strongest steel by the Peace Council of the Emerald Planet.  He is created to destroy evil and restore peace in the universe.  Resembling a Japanese man in white tights/cowl (fitted with an antenna) and capes under his arms, he is virtually indestructible.  He wears on his wrist a \"Globe-Meter\" device, which enables him to:\n\nHe can also use it to disguise himself as an Earthling to walk among them.  When sent to Earth to fight evildoers, he disguises himself as a Japanese man wearing an ordinary suit and fedora hat (looking almost like a police detective), but still uses his \"Super Giant\" name.  His secret identity is not that secret, as he works with the Japanese authorities to help them fight evildoers. He is just as powerful in his civilian form. He also gets along with Earth children, and saves them from danger, as he knows that children represent the Earth's future. After accomplishing his mission, Super Giant always flies back to the Emerald Planet.\n\nSuper Giant was played in all nine films by respected film/TV actor Ken Utsui.  However, Utsui hated playing Super Giant and, right up to his death, always played down the role. This was partially on account of the somewhat embarrassing costume, especially the overstuffed crotch area (he said the producers thought that female viewers were attracted to well-endowed men, so they stuffed the crotch area of Utsui's costume with cotton). Whatever Utsui's feelings about the role, his earnest and heroic interpretation of the character made lasting impact on a generation's children all over the world.\n\n"

The satellite is armed with weapons that could destroy whole cities on Earth from afar. (Part 1 of 2)\n\nThis film is part of the U.S. version Attack from Space.\n\nSuper Giant - The Spaceship and the Clash of the Artificial Satellite (スーパー・ジャイアンツ 宇宙艇と人工衛星の激突 - Sūpā Jaiantsu - Uchūtei to Jinkō Eisei no Gekitotsu) is a 1958 black and white Japanese film directed by Teruo Ishii.\n\nPlot: Although he was believed to be destroyed by the Nazi-like army, Super Giant breaks into the satellite, and a long, riotous battle ensues. (Part 2 of 2)\n\nThis film is part of the U.S. version Attack from Space.\n\nTrivia: It was after this film was made that director Teruo Ishii left the series, upon hearing of a child who imitated Super Giant (even wearing a hand-made cape) by jumping out of a window and landing on the street below, seriously injuring himself. This became a controversial liability issue with Japanese superhero programs (not unlike those in America), until shows like Android Kikaider (1972) added a safety bumper at the end of each episode, telling children not to imitate the impossible feats performed by the title superhero.\n\nThis was the last Super Giant film with a two-part story arc; the remaining films were stand-alone episodes, and none of them from this point on were directed by Teruo Ishii.\n\nSuper Giant - The Space Mutant Appears (スーパー・ジャイアンツ 宇宙怪人出現 - Sūpā  Jaiantsu - Uchū Kaijin Shutsugen) is a 1958 black and white Japanese film directed by Akira Mitsuwa.\n\nPlot: Super Giant battles a marauding alien brain-like creature created by a mad scientist and an alien army.

(stand-alone episode)\n\nThis film is part of the U.S. version Evil Brain from Outer Space. Despite the fact it was filmed in color and Scope, footage from this episode was incorporated into the English-language film, converted to black and white. Evil Brain from Outer Space contains sequences featuring both the disfigured scientist and the witch creature. To fit within the US versions story arc, the witch is described as another \"mutant\".\n\nTrivia: The only Super Giant film made in both color and widescreen (2.35:1).\n\nSuper Giant Continues - Kingdom of the Poison Moth (続スーパー・ジャイアンツ 毒蛾王国 - Zoku Sūpā  Jaiantsu - Dokuga Ōkoku) is a 1959 black and white widescreen Japanese film directed by Chogi Akasaka.\n\nPlot: Super Giant fights against an Arab terrorist army (who wear costumes that look similar to the aliens' costumes in The Space Mutant Appears) which plots to assassinate its nation's peaceful crown prince for his treasure.
