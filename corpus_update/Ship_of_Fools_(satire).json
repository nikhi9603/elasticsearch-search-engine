            "text": "Ship of Fools was published in 1494 in Basel, Switzerland, by Sebastian Brant.[1] The book consists of a prologue, 112 brief satires, and an epilogue, all illustrated with woodcuts.[2] Brant takes up the ship of fools trope, popular at the time, lashing with unsparing vigour the weaknesses and vices of his time.[citation needed] He conceives Saint Grobian, whom he imagines to be the patron saint of vulgar and coarse people.[citation needed]\n\nThe concept of foolishness was a frequently used trope in the pre-Reformation period to legitimise criticism, as also used by Erasmus in his Praise of Folly and Martin Luther in his \"An den christlichen Adel deutscher Nation von des christlichen Standes Besserung\" (Address to the Christian Nobility).[citation needed] Court fools were allowed to say much what they wanted; by writing his work in the voice of the fool, Brant could legitimise his criticism of the church.[citation needed]\n\nThe work immediately became extremely popular, being published in Reutlingen, Nuremberg, Strasbourg and Augsburg with six authorized and several unauthorized editions until 1512.[1] Brant's own views on humanism and the new, revolutionary views on Christianity emerging in the sixteenth century are unclear. The debate still continues whether the Ship of Fools is itself a humanist work or just a remnant of Medieval sensibilities.[3]\n\nThe book was translated into Latin by Jakob Locher [de] in 1497,[4][1] into French by Pierre Rivière [fr] in 1497 and by Jean Drouyn in 1498, into English by Alexander Barclay  and by Henry Watsonin 1509.\n\nOf the 103 woodcuts, two thirds are attributed to the young Albrecht Dürer[1] and the additional wood-cuts are the work of the so-called Haintz-Nar-Meister [de], the gnad-her-Meister and two other anonymous artists.[citation needed]\n\nAn allegorical painting by Hieronymus Bosch, The Ship of Fools, a fragment of a triptych said to have been painted by Bosch between 1490 and 1500, may have been influenced by the frontispiece for the book.[citation needed] It is on display in the Louvre Museum in Paris.\n\n"
