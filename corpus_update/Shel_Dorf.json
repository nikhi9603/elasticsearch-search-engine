            "text": "In 1964 back in Detroit, teenager Robert Brosch organised a convention for fans of the comics medium, which Dorf and Jerry Bails,  the \"father of comics fandom,\" attended.[7] The next year Dorf and Bails took over the event, christening it the \"Detroit Triple Fan Fair\"  (referring to fantasy literature, fantasy films, and comic art)[9] and organizing it as an annual event. The Detroit Triple Fan Fair (DTFF) is credited as being the first regularly held convention featuring comic books as a major component.[10] Dorf went on to produce the DTFF in 1967[11]  and 1968 as well.\n\nIn 1970, Dorf moved to San Diego, California,[12] to take care of his aging parents. Almost immediately, he organized a one-day convention \"as a kind of 'dry run' for the larger convention he hoped to stage,\"[4] with Forrest J Ackerman as the star attraction.\n\nDorf's first three-day San Diego comics convention, the Golden State Comic-Con,[12] was held at the U. S. Grant Hotel[12] from August 1–3, 1970.[13] It would eventually grow into the San Diego Comic-Con International,[14] now considered the standard bearer for U.S. comic conventions. The convention moved in subsequent years to the El Cortez Hotel; the University of California, San Diego; and Golden Hall, before settling into the San Diego Convention center in 1991.[15]\n\nAs \"'Founding Father' of San Diego Comic-Con,\" Dorf received an Inkpot Award at the 1975 San Diego Comic-Con.[16]\n\nIn 1984 Dorf began compilation and editing of the Dick Tracy comic strips in comic book format for Blackthorne Publishing, \"proudly\"[17] publishing ninety-nine issues and collecting the material again in twenty-four collections.[17]\n\nChester Gould's daughter, Jean Gould O'Connell credits Dorf with bringing \"Tracy out to another generation.\"[17] Comics historian Mark Evanier said Caniff \"honored Shel by making him into a character. It was a well-meaning football player named \"Thud Shelley\" who appeared a few times in the Canyon strip. Jack Kirby also made Shel into a character ... a father figure named Himon who appeared in Mister Miracle.[4] In 1990, Dorf was employed as a consultant on Warren Beatty's big-screen adaptation of Dick Tracy.[3][18]\n\nDorf would also contribute interviews to the comics press and movie collector magazines (including for The Buyer's Guide for Comic Fandom [TBG] and Film Collector's World), and his conversations with Milton Caniff and Mort Walker have both been collected in the University Press of Mississippi's Milton Caniff: Conversations and Mort Walker: Conversations respectively. His interview with Wally Wood (among the few to see print) for TBG was reprinted in Comic Book Artist #14 (July 2001).\n\n"
