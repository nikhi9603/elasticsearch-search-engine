Oksanen (7 August 1826 – 20 November 1889), was a Finnish professor, poet, scholar of the Finno-Ugric languages, author, and literary critic.[1] Today, he is best remembered as the sharpest critic of writer Aleksis Kivi, who later rose to the position of the national author of Finland.[2]\n\n"

            "text": "He was born in Kuopio, Finland. He was the illegitimate child of Baron Johan Mauritz Nordenstam (1802-1882); his mother Maria Augusta Ahlqvist (1806-1886) was a servant.[2]\n\nHe became a student at the Imperial Alexander University (now University of Helsinki) in 1844. He was a Philosophy candidate 1853, Licentiate of Law 1854 and took a Doctor of Philosophy in 1859. In 1863, he became a professor of Finnish language and literature at the University of Helsinki. He became Dean of the History-Linguistic Section 1882–1884. He served as the university's Rector from 1884 to 1887. He resigned as emeritus in 1888. He died in 1889 at  Helsinki, Finland.[3]\n\nIn 1846 and 1847, he traveled through the eastern part of Ostrobothnia, as well as Finnish and Russian Karelia, partly gathering local folk tales and partly to investigate minorities languages. In 1854–55, he spent on research trips among the Finnish tribes in the Baltic Sea provinces, the province of Olonets and eastern Russia and Siberia. Between 1856 and 1859, he studied Finno-Ugric languages in the areas of Volga River and the Ural Mountains. In 1861 and 1862, he was in  Hungary  returning with the results of his ethnographic and linguistic observations.[4]\n\nAs a scholar Ahlqvist contributed to reformation of the Finnish language, and was highly esteemed for his work in the Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian and related languages.  He founded the Finnish language magazine Suometar  in 1847 which was published until 1866 and later also founded the Finnish linguistic journal Kieletär which was published between 1871 and 1875. Ahlqvist was also the first to translate the works of Johan Ludvig Runeberg (1804–1877) into Finnish. As a literary critic Ahlqvist was uncompromising. His pungent criticism of Seitsemän veljestä by Aleksis Kivi (1834–1872)  caused the publishers to postpone its issue.[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n\n"
