One who writes scholia is a scholiast.  The earliest attested use of the word dates to the 1st century BC.[1]\n\n"

The earliest scholia, usually anonymous, date to the 5th or 4th century BC (such as the scholia minora to the Iliad). The practice of compiling scholia continued to late Byzantine times, outstanding examples being Archbishop Eustathius' massive commentaries to Homer in the 12th century and the scholia recentiora of Thomas Magister, Demetrius Triclinius and Manuel Moschopoulos in the 14th.\n\nScholia were altered by successive copyists and owners of the manuscript, and in some cases, increased to such an extent that there was no longer room for them in the margin, and it became necessary to make them into a separate work. At first, they were taken from one commentary only, and subsequently from several. This is indicated by the repetition of the lemma (\"headword\"), or by the use of such phrases as \"or thus\", \"alternatively\", \"according to some\", to introduce different explanations, or by the explicit quotation of different sources.\n\n"
