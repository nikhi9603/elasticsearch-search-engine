            "text": "A parade is a procession of people, usually organized along a street, often in costume, and often accompanied by marching bands, floats, or sometimes large balloons. Parades are held for a wide range of reasons, but are usually celebrations of some kind. In British English, the term 'parade' is usually reserved for either military parades or other occasions where participants march in formation; for celebratory occasions, the word procession is more usual.[citation needed] In the Canadian Forces, the term also has several less formal connotations.[1]\n\nProtest demonstrations can also take the form of a parade, but such cases are usually referred to as a march instead.\n\n"

            "title": "Parade float",
            "text": "The parade float got its name because the first floats were decorated barges that were towed along the canals with ropes held by parade marchers on the shore[citation needed]. Floats were occasionally propelled from within by concealed oarsmen, but the practice was abandoned because of the high incidence of drowning when the lightweight and unstable frames capsized. Strikingly, among the first uses of grounded floats — towed by horses — was a ceremony in memory of recently drowned parade oarsmen.[citation needed]  Today, parade floats are traditionally pulled by motor vehicles or are powered themselves.\n\n"

            "text": "Multiple grand marshals may often be designated for an iteration of the parade, and may or may not be in actual attendance due to circumstances (including death). A community grand marshal or other designations may be selected alongside a grand marshal to lead the front or other parts of the parade.\n\n"

            "title": "Aircraft and boats",
            "text": "Since the advent of such technology, it became possible for aircraft and boats to parade. A flypast is an aerial parade of anything from one to dozens of aircraft, both in commercial context at airshows and also to mark, e.g., national days or significant anniversaries. They are particularly common in the United Kingdom, where they are often associated with Royal occasions. Similarly, for ships, there may be a sail-past of, e.g., tall ships (as was seen during Trafalgar 200) or other sailing vessels as during the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of World War II.\n\n"

The parade is 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) long with more than 12,000 participants from all over the world, among them more than 100 bands and around 70 floats and carriages.[2]\n\n"

            "title": "Historical parades",
            "text": "To celebrate the federal government's victory in the American Civil War, 145,000 Union soldiers marched in a two-day Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C.  They passed before the President, the Cabinet, and senior officers from May 23–24, 1865.\n\nAt the end of hostilities in Europe in 1944–45, \"victory parades\" were a common feature throughout the recently liberated territories. For example, on 3 September 1944, the personnel of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division marched six abreast to the music of massed regimental pipe and drum bands through the streets of Dieppe, France, to commemorate the liberation of the city from German occupation, as well as commemorate the loss of over 900 soldiers from that formation during the Dieppe Raid two years earlier.[3] On the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945 held in Moscow, Soviet Union in June 1945, the Red Army commemorated Victory in Europe with a parade and the ceremonial destruction of captured Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS standards.\n\n"
