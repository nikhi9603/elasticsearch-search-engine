            "text": "During the last decades, percolation theory, the mathematical study of percolation, has brought new understanding and techniques to a broad range of topics in physics, materials science, complex networks, epidemiology, and other fields. For example, in geology, percolation refers to filtration of water through soil and permeable rocks. The water flows to recharge the groundwater in the water table and aquifers. In places where infiltration basins or septic drain fields are planned to dispose of substantial amounts of water, a percolation test is needed beforehand to determine whether the intended structure is  likely to succeed or fail.\nIn two dimensional square lattice  percolation is defined as follows. A site is \"occupied\" with\nprobability p or \"empty\" (in which case its edges are removed) with probability 1 â€“ p; the\ncorresponding problem is called site percolation, see Fig. 2.\n\nPercolation typically exhibits universality. Statistical physics concepts such as scaling theory, renormalization, phase transition, critical phenomena and fractals are used to characterize percolation properties.\nCombinatorics is commonly employed to study percolation thresholds.\n\nDue to the complexity involved in obtaining exact results from analytical models of percolation, computer simulations are typically used.  The current fastest algorithm for percolation was published in 2000 by Mark Newman and Robert Ziff.[1]\n\n"
