In some versions, he will ask if they want red paper or blue paper, though other versions identify the choices as a red cloak or a blue cloak, or as a red cape or a blue cape. Choosing either option will result in the individual being killed, so the individual must ignore the spirit, run away, or reject both options in order to survive.\n\n"

            "text": "Aka Manto is described as a male spirit, ghost, or yōkai who haunts public or school bathrooms.[4] Aka Manto is often said to haunt female bathrooms specifically, and in some versions of the legend, he is said to haunt the last stall in such bathrooms.[4] The spirit is said to wear a flowing red cloak and a mask which hides his face, and is sometimes described as being handsome and charming beneath his mask.[3][4]\n\nAccording to legend, if a person is sitting on a toilet in a public or school bathroom, Aka Manto may appear, and will ask them if they want red paper or blue paper.[3][5] Depending on the version of the story, the spirit may ask them to choose between a red cloak and a blue cloak,[6] or between a red cape and a blue cape. If they choose the \"red\" option, they will be lacerated in such a manner that their dead body will be drenched in their own blood.[7] The specific manner in which the person is lacerated differs depending on the account of the legend, including the person being stabbed or flayed.[1] Their body could also be ripped off their spine and tied around their neck as if it was a red cape. If the individual chooses the \"blue\" option, the consequences range from that person being strangled to all of the person's blood being drained from their body.[8]\n\nIf an individual attempts to outsmart Aka Manto by asking for a different color of paper, cloak, or cape, it is often said that they will be dragged to an underworld or hell as a result.[9][10] In some versions, choosing a \"yellow\" paper, cloak or cape will result in the occupant's head being forced into the toilet.[1][11] Ignoring the spirit, or replying that one does not want or prefer either kind of paper, is said to make the spirit go away.[11] In some accounts, rejecting both options and running away from Aka Manto will also result in the individual's survival.[1]\n\n"

            "text": "Author and folklorist Matthew Meyer has stated that the Aka Manto has been recorded as a schoolyard rumor dating back as early as the 1930's.[1] In that time, the word manto commonly referred to a sleeveless kimono-style jacket, whereas in the modern-day, manto is the Japanese word for cloak or cape.[1] Because of this, different generations have had differing views of Aka Manto's supposed physical appearance.[1]\n\n\n\n"

He offers them the choice of a red or a blue paper tile, but this choice does not affect the outcome. Hwang Dong-hyuk, the show's director, confirmed in an interview that this was a reference to the Aka Manto legend.[16]\n\n"
