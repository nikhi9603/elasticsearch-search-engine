A legend states that it would slip into darkness at night and pull on people's legs, making them fall over. Children were made to fall over and hurt their noses.[3]\n\n"

            "text": "They have been given various appearances in fictional works. In Mizuki Shigeru's manga GeGeGe no Kitarō, it takes on the appearance of a cat rolled into a ball. People who claimed to have actually witnessed one often claim that \"it was like a cat\". Yōkai researcher Yamaguchi Binatarō claimed that this was because of Mizuki Shigeru's influence.[4] Some netsuke resemble Mizuki's design,[5] creating the possibility that they referred to Mizuki's design.\n\nIn the movie The Great Yokai War sunekosuri appeared as yellow and white lumps of hair with cute eyes.[6]\n\nIn the 2018 anime adaptation of GeGeGe no Kitarō, the sunekokusuri takes the appearance of a small, chubby, tabby cat, having forgotten his true form. It appears as a bakeneko creature feeding on human lifeforce, forced to leave his dwelling. While the village was thriving he could easily feed from many people and never harm anyone, but with the massive population decline in rural Japan he ended up unwillingly stealing too much lifeforce from the remaining, elderly citizens.\n\nIn the 2020 video game Nioh 2, the sunekosuri- localized as \"Scampuss\"- appears as a helpful yokai that looks like a chubby cat and aids the player.\n\n"
