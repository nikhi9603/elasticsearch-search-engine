Not wanting to leave the infant to die and because of her resemblance to his dead daughter, he takes the child home with him- only to discover that the child grows at an extraordinarily fast rate. Incredibly beautiful, the now grown child Kaya (Yasuko Sawaguchi) attracts the attention of everyone around her, including the land's Emperor. Unwilling to accept their advances, Kaya gives the men a list of increasingly difficult tasks. By the film's end Kaya returns to outer-space by way of a space ship.\n\n"

Ichikawa noted that he had wanted to make this film for many years, and said his intention was to make it a \"film of pure diversion\".[5] The film was selected as the opening film of the Tokyo International Film Festival, where it was not well received by critics.[6] Toho promoted the film heavily, and it had the second highest theatrical returns of any film that  year, but its financial performance did not equal that of Ichikawa's 1985 release Harp of Burma.[5]\n\n"
