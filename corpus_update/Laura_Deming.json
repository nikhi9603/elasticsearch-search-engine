At age 8, Deming became interested in the biology of aging,[4] and at age 12 she joined the lab of Cynthia Kenyon at the University of California, San Francisco.[3][5] Kenyon successfully increased the lifespan of the worm C. elegans by a factor of ten through genetic engineering.[citation needed][6] Deming was accepted to MIT at age 14 and studied physics,[5][7] but later dropped out to accept the $100,000 Thiel Fellowship and start a venture capital firm.[8] Deming was one of only two women in the 2011 initial class of Thiel Fellows.[9]\n\n"
