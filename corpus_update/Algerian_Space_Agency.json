Since its launch, this project has been the subject of several stages of discussions and validation as well technical as political and institutional.[5]\n\n"

They mainly use the use of satellite remote sensing, satellite positioning (GPS, Glonas, Galileo in perspective), space telecommunications services, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), offering to different national sectors Powerful tools for decision-making. These projects are based on: national competences; space systems, national and international image providers and operational entities within the Algerian Space Agency.[6]\n\n"

The objective of the mission is to provide medium resolution multispectral images for monitoring natural disasters as well as other thematic remote sensing applications.[7]\n\nAlsat-1B is a satellite designed for agricultural and disaster monitoring. It was launched on the Indian ISRO PSLV-C35 mission on Monday, September 26, 2016.[8]\n\nAlsat-2A was successfully launched from the Sriharikota site near Chennai (South-East of India) on 12 July 2010, as an Algerian Earth observation satellite . Since its launch, Alsat-2A has provided nearly 30,000 images.[9]\n\nAlsat-2B is similar to Alsat-2A, but integrated in Algeria within the small satellite development center (UDPS) in Oran.[10]\n\nAlsat-1N contains amateur radio payloads and was launched on the Indian ISRO PSLV-C35 mission at 0342 GMT on Monday, September 26, 2016.[11]\n\nAlcomsat-1 : is the first Algerian communication satellite, it was successfully launched Sunday afternoon, carried by Chinese launcher Long March 3B, from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center.[12]\n\n"
