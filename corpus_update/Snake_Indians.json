            "text": "Snake Indians is a collective name given to the Northern Paiute, Bannock, and Shoshone Native American tribes.\n\nThe term was used as early as 1739 by French trader and explorer Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, Sieur de la Verendrye when he described hearing of the Gens du Serpent (\"Snake people\") from the Mandans.  This is probably the first written mention of the Shoshone people.  The term \"Snakes\" is also used to refer the Shoshone by British explorers David Thompson and Anthony Henday.[1]\n\nThe term was also used by Plains Tribes to refer to the Shoshone. They called the Shoshone \"snake\" referring to the Shoshone sign in Plains Indian Sign Language for the Shoshone people. The sign was used for salmon but the fish was unknown on the Great Plains.[2]\n\nThis term was widely used by American immigrants on the Oregon Trail in the Snake River and Owyhee River valleys of southern Idaho and Eastern Oregon.[3][4] The term \"Snake Indian\" later included the Northern Paiute tribes found in the basins between the Cascade Mountains and these valleys in Oregon and northern Nevada and northeastern California. These people were the opponents of the California, Oregon and Washington Volunteers and U.S. Army, in the Snake War.\n\n"
