At times he is well educated in the terminology of sex, while at others he is all too innocent. The jokes may also include a female counterpart, typically named Susie.\n\n"

The character became very famous in Italy between the seventies and eighties, in the period of Italian zany and erotic comedy on cinema. Four movies about Pierino were made, all starring Alvaro Vitali.\n\n"
