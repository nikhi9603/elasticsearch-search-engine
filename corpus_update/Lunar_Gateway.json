            "text": "\n\nThe Lunar Gateway, or simply Gateway, is the first planned extraterrestrial space station in lunar orbit intended to serve as a solar-powered communication hub, science laboratory, and short-term habitation module for government-agency astronauts, as well as a holding area for rovers and other robots. It is a multinational collaborative project involving four of the International Space Station partner agencies: NASA, European Space Agency (ESA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and Canadian Space Agency (CSA). It is planned to be both the first space station beyond low Earth orbit and the first space station to orbit the Moon.[4][5]\n\nFormerly known as the Deep Space Gateway (DSG), the station was renamed Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway (LOP-G) in NASA's 2018 proposal for the 2019 United States federal budget.[6][7] When the budgeting process was complete[when?], US$332 million had been committed by Congress to preliminary studies.[clarification needed][8][9][10]\n\nThe science disciplines to be studied on the Gateway are expected to include planetary science, astrophysics, Earth observation, heliophysics, fundamental space biology, and human health and performance.[11] Construction is planned to take place in the 2020s.[12][13][14] The International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG), which is composed of more than 14 space agencies including all the major ones, has concluded that Gateway will be critical in expanding human presence to the Moon, Mars, and deeper into the Solar System.[15]\n\nThe project is expected to play a major role in NASA's Artemis program, after 2024. While the project is led by NASA, the Gateway is meant to be developed, serviced, and utilized in collaboration with the CSA, ESA, JAXA, and commercial partners. It will serve as the staging point for both robotic and crewed exploration of the lunar south pole and is the proposed staging point for NASA's Deep Space Transport concept for transport to Mars.[16][12][17]\n\n"

            "text": "An earlier NASA proposal for a cislunar station had been made public in 2012 and was dubbed the Deep Space Habitat. That proposal led to funding in 2015 under the NextSTEP program to study the requirements of deep space habitats.[18] In February 2018, it was announced that the NextSTEP studies and other ISS partner studies would help to guide the capabilities required of the Gateway's habitation modules.[19] The solar electric Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) of the Gateway was originally a part of the now-canceled Asteroid Redirect Mission.[20][21] On 7 November 2017, NASA asked the global science community to submit concepts for scientific studies that could take advantage of the Deep Space Gateway's location in cislunar space.[11] The Deep Space Gateway Concept Science Workshop was held in Denver, Colorado, from 27 February to 1 March 2018. This three-day conference was a workshop where 196 presentations were given for possible scientific studies that could be advanced through the use of the Gateway.[22]\n\nIn 2018, NASA initiated the Revolutionary Aerospace Systems Concepts Academic Linkage (RASC-AL) competition for universities to develop concepts and capabilities for the Gateway. The competitors were asked to employ original engineering and analysis in one of four areas; \"Gateway Uncrewed Utilization and Operations\", \"Gateway-Based Human Lunar Surface Access\", \"Gateway Logistics as a Science Platform\", and \"Design of a Gateway-Based Cislunar Tug\". Teams of undergraduate and graduate students were asked to submit a response by 17 January 2019 addressing one of these four themes. NASA selected 20 teams to continue developing proposed concepts. Fourteen of the teams presented their projects in person in June 2019 at the RASC-AL Forum in Cocoa Beach, Florida, receiving a US$6,000 stipend to participate in the Forum.[5] The \"Lunar Exploration and Access to Polar Regions\" from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez was the winning concept.[23]\n\nNASA unveiled the name of the lunar-orbit space station in November 2019, and the Gateway with its name and logo associated with the American frontier symbol of the St. Louis Gateway Arch.[24]\n\nOn 27 September 2017, an informal joint statement on cooperation regarding the program between NASA and Russia's Roscosmos was announced.[14] However, in October 2020 Dmitry Rogozin, director general of Roscosmos, said that the program is too “U.S.-centric” for Roscosmos to participate in,[25] and in January 2021, Roscosmos announced that it would not participate in the program.[26]\n\nBy May 2020, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) all planned to participate in the Gateway project, contributing a robotic arm, refueling and communications hardware, and habitation and research capacity. Those international elements are intended to launch after the initial NASA PPE and HALO elements are placed into lunar orbit.[27][full citation needed]\n\nOn 1 November 2017, NASA commissioned five studies lasting four months into affordable ways to develop the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE), leveraging private companies' plans. These studies had a combined budget of US$2.4 million. The companies performing the PPE studies were Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada and Space Systems/Loral.[28][21] These awards are in addition to the ongoing set of NextSTEP-2 awards made in 2016 to study development and make ground prototypes of habitat modules that could be used on the Gateway as well as other commercial applications,[17] so the Gateway is likely to incorporate components developed under NextSTEP as well.[21][29] The PPE will use four 6 kW BHT-6000 Busek Hall-effect thrusters[30][31][32] and two 12.5 kW NASA/Aerojet Rocketdyne Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS) Hall-effect thrusters for a total engine output fractionally under 50 kW.[33] In 2019, the contract to manufacture the PPE was awarded to Maxar Technologies.[34] After a one-year demonstration period, NASA would then \"exercise a contract option to take over control of the spacecraft\".[35] Its expected service time is about 15 years.[36]\n\n"

            "text": "The Gateway is planned to be deployed in a highly elliptical seven-day near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) around the Moon, which would bring the station within 1,500 km (930 mi) over the lunar north pole surface at closest approach and as far away as 70,000 km (43,000 mi) over the lunar south pole.[3][37][38] Traveling to and from cislunar space (lunar orbit) is intended to develop the knowledge and experience necessary to venture beyond the Moon and into deep space. The proposed NRHO would allow lunar expeditions from the Gateway to reach a low polar orbit with a delta-v of 730 m/s and a half a day of transit time. Orbital station-keeping would require less than 10 m/s of delta-v per year, and the orbital inclination could be shifted with a relatively small delta-v expenditure, allowing access to most of the lunar surface. Spacecraft launched from Earth would perform a powered flyby of the Moon (delta-v ≈ 180 m/s) followed by a ≈240 m/s delta-v NRHO insertion burn to dock with the Gateway as it approaches the apoapsis point of its orbit. The total travel time would be 5 days; the return to Earth would be similar in terms of trip duration and delta-v requirement if the spacecraft spends 11 days at the Gateway. The crewed mission duration of 21 days and ≈840 m/s delta-v are limited by the capabilities of the Orion life support and propulsion systems.[39]\n\nOne of the advantages of an NRHO is the minimal amount of communications blackout with the Earth.\n\nGateway will be the first modular space station to be both human-rated, and autonomously operating most of the time in its early years, as well as being the first deep-space station, far from low Earth orbit. This will be enabled by more sophisticated executive control software than on any prior space station, which will monitor and control all systems. The high-level architecture is provided by the Robotics and Intelligence for Human Spaceflight lab at NASA and implemented at NASA facilities. The Gateway could conceivably also support in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) development and testing from lunar and asteroid sources,[40] and would offer the opportunity for a gradual buildup of capabilities for more complex missions over time.[41]\n\n"

            "text": "NASA officials promote the Gateway as a \"reusable command module\" that could direct activities on the lunar surface.[80] However, the Gateway has received both positive and negative reactions from space professionals.\n\nMichael D. Griffin, a former NASA administrator, said that the Gateway could be useful only after there are facilities on the Moon producing propellant that could be transported to the Gateway. Griffin thinks that after that is achieved, the Gateway would then serve as a fuel depot.[80]\n\nClive Neal, a Notre Dame geologist and advocate for the lunar exploration program, called the Gateway \"a waste of money\" and stated that NASA is \"not fulfilling space policy by building an orbital space station around the Moon\".[81]\n\nFormer NASA Associate Administrator Doug Cooke wrote in an article on The Hill stating, \"NASA can significantly increase speed, simplicity, cost and probability of mission success by deferring Gateway, leveraging SLS, and reducing critical mission operations\". He also wrote, \"NASA should launch the lander elements (ascent and descent/transfer) on an SLS Block 1B. If an independent transfer element is required, it can be launched on a commercial launcher\".[82]\n\nGeorge Abbey, a former director of NASA's Johnson Space Center, said, \"The Gateway is, in essence, building a space station to orbit a natural space station, namely the Moon. [...] If we are going to return to the Moon, we should go directly there, not build a space station to orbit it\".[83]\n\nFormer NASA astronaut Terry W. Virts, who was a pilot of STS-130 aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour and commander of the ISS on Expedition 43, wrote in an Op-ed on Ars Technica that the Gateway would \"shackle human exploration, not enable it\". He also said, \"If we don't have the goal [of Gateway], we are putting the proverbial chicken before the egg by developing \"Gemini\" before we know what \"Apollo\" will look like. Regardless of a future destination, as someone who lived on the ISS for 200 days, I cannot envision a new technology that would be developed or validated by building another modular space station. Without a specific goal, we're unlikely to ever identify one\". Terry further criticized NASA for abandoning its planned goal of separating crew from cargo, which was put in place following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003.[84] Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin stated that he is \"quite opposed to the Gateway\" and that \"using the Gateway as a staging area for robotic or human missions to the lunar surface is absurd\". Aldrin also questioned the benefit of the idea of sending \"a crew to an intermediate point in space, pick up a lander there and go down\". On the other hand, Aldrin expressed support for Robert Zubrin's Moon Direct concept which involves lunar landers traveling from Earth orbit to the lunar surface and back.[85]\n\nPei Zhaoyu, deputy director of the Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center of the China National Space Administration (CNSA), concluded that the Gateway would have \"low cost-effectiveness\".[86] Pei said the Chinese plan is to focus on a national research station on the surface.[87] In July 2019, Pei announced that China was holding discussions with Russia and the ESA on international co-operation[88] and in August 2020 unveiled China's concept; the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS)[89] with co-operation from Russia and tentative agreement from ESA.\n\nMars advocacy and Mars Society founder Robert Zubrin called the Gateway \"NASA's worst plan yet\" in an article in the National Review. He said, \"We do not need a lunar-orbiting station to go to the Moon. We do not need such a station to go to Mars. We do not need it to go to near-Earth asteroids. We do not need it to go anywhere. Nor can we accomplish anything in such a station that we cannot do in the Earth-orbiting International Space Station, except to expose human subjects to irradiation – a form of medical research for which a number of Nazi doctors were hanged\". Zubrin also stated, \"If the goal is to build a Moon base, it should be built on the surface of the Moon. That is where the science is, that is where the shielding material is, and that is where the resources to make propellant and other useful things are to be found\".[90]\n\nRetired aerospace engineer Gerald Black stated that the Gateway is \"useless for supporting human return to the lunar surface and a lunar base\". He added that it was not planned to be used as a rocket fuel depot and that stopping at the Gateway on the way to or from the Moon would serve no useful purpose and cost propellant.[91]\n\nMark Whittington, who is a contributor to The Hill newspaper and an author of several space exploration studies, stated in an article that the \"lunar orbit project doesn't help us get back to the Moon\". Whittington also pointed out that a lunar orbiting space station was not utilized during the Apollo program and that a \"reusable lunar lander could be refueled from a depot on the lunar surface and left in a parking orbit between missions without the need for a big, complex space station\".[92]\n\nAstrophysicist Ethan Siegel wrote an article in Forbes titled \"NASA's Idea For A Space Station In Lunar Orbit Takes Humanity Nowhere\". Siegel stated that \"Orbiting the Moon represents barely incremental progress; the only scientific \"advantages\" to being in lunar orbit as opposed to low Earth orbit are twofold: 1. You're outside of the Van Allen belts. 2. You're closer to the lunar surface\", reducing the time delay. His final opinion was that the Gateway is \"a great way to spend a great deal of money, advancing science and humanity in no appreciable way\".[93]\n\nOn 10 December 2018, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said at a presentation \"There are people who say we need to get there, and we need to get there tomorrow\", speaking of a crewed mission to the Moon, countering with \"What we're doing here at NASA is following Space Policy Directive 1\", speaking of the Gateway and following up with \"I would argue that we got there in 1969. That race is over, and we won. The time now is to build a sustainable, reusable architecture. [...] The next time we go to the moon, we're going to have American boots on the moon with the American flag on their shoulders, and they're going to be standing side-by-side with our international partners who have never been to the moon before\".[94]\n\n\nDan Hartman, the program manager for Gateway, on 30 March 2020, told Ars Technica that the benefits of using Gateway are extending the mission duration, buying down risk, providing research capability and the capability to re-use ascent modules.\n"
