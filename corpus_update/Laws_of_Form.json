Miller of University College London for helping with the proof reading and offering other guidance. In 1963 Spencer Brown was invited by Harry Frost, staff lecturer in the physical sciences at the department of Extra-Mural Studies of the University of London to deliver a course on the mathematics of logic.\n\nLoF emerged from work in electronic engineering its author did around 1960, and from subsequent lectures on mathematical logic he gave under the auspices of the University of London's extension program. LoF has appeared in several editions. The second series of editions appeared in 1972 with the \"Preface to the First American Edition\" which emphasised the use of self-referential paradoxes.[2] the most recent being a 1997 German translation, and has never gone out of print.\n\nLoF's mystical and declamatory prose and its love of paradox make it a challenging read for all. Spencer-Brown was influenced by Wittgenstein and R. D. Laing. LoF also echoes a number of themes from the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce, Bertrand Russell, and Alfred North Whitehead.\n\nThe entire book is written in an operational way, giving instructions to the reader instead of telling them what \"is\". In accordance with G. Spencer-Brown's interest in paradoxes, the only sentence that makes a statement that something is, is the statement which says no such statements are used in this book.[3] Except for this one sentence the book can be seen as an example of E-Prime.\n\n"

LoF argues that primary algebra reveals striking connections among logic, Boolean algebra, and arithmetic, and the philosophy of language and mind.\n\nBanaschewski (1977)[5] argues that the primary algebra is nothing but new notation for Boolean algebra. Indeed, the two-element Boolean algebra 2 can be seen as the intended interpretation of the primary algebra. Yet the notation of the primary algebra:\n\nMoreover, the syntax of the primary algebra can be extended to formal systems other than 2 and sentential logic, resulting in boundary mathematics (see § Related Work below).\n\nLoF has influenced, among others, Heinz von Foerster, Louis Kauffman, Niklas Luhmann, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela and William Bricken. Some of these authors have modified the primary algebra in a variety of interesting ways.\n\nLoF claimed that certain well-known mathematical conjectures of very long standing, such as the four color theorem, Fermat's Last Theorem, and the Goldbach conjecture, are provable using extensions of the primary algebra. Spencer-Brown eventually circulated a purported proof of the four color theorem, but it met with skepticism.[6]\n\n"

In Spencer-Brown's inimitable and enigmatic fashion, the Mark symbolizes the root of cognition, i.e., the dualistic Mark indicates the capability of differentiating a \"this\" from \"everything else but this\".\n\nIn LoF, a Cross denotes the drawing of a \"distinction\", and can be thought of as signifying the following, all at once:\n\nAll three ways imply an action on the part of the cognitive entity (e.g., person) making the distinction.  As LoF puts it:\n\nThe counterpoint to the Marked state is the Unmarked state, which is simply nothing, the void, or the un-expressable infinite represented by a blank space. It is simply the absence of a Cross. No distinction has been made and nothing has been crossed. The Marked state and the void are the two primitive values of the Laws of Form.\n\nThe Cross can be seen as denoting the distinction between two states, one \"considered as a symbol\" and another not so considered. From this fact arises a curious resonance with some theories of consciousness and language. Paradoxically, the Form is at once Observer and Observed, and is also the creative act of making an observation. LoF (excluding back matter) closes with the words:\n\nC. S.

            "text": "The syntax of the primary arithmetic goes as follows. There are just two atomic expressions:\n\nThere are two inductive rules:\n\nThe semantics of the primary arithmetic are perhaps nothing more than the sole explicit definition in LoF: \"Distinction is perfect continence\".\n\nLet the \"unmarked state\" be a synonym for the void. Let an empty Cross denote the \"marked state\". To cross is to move from one value, the unmarked or marked state, to the other. We can now state the \"arithmetical\" axioms A1 and A2, which ground the primary arithmetic (and hence all of the Laws of Form):\n\n\"A1. The law of Calling\". Calling twice from a state is indistinguishable from calling once. To make a distinction twice has the same effect as making it once. For example, saying \"Let there be light\" and then saying \"Let there be light\" again, is the same as saying it once.  Formally:\n\n\"A2. The law of Crossing\". After crossing from the unmarked to the marked state, crossing again (\"recrossing\") starting from the marked state returns one to the unmarked state. Hence recrossing annuls crossing. Formally:\n\nIn both A1 and A2, the expression to the right of '=' has fewer symbols than the expression to the left of '='. This suggests that every primary arithmetic expression can, by repeated application of A1 and A2, be simplified to one of two states: the marked or the unmarked state. This is indeed the case, and the result is the expression's \"simplification\". The two fundamental metatheorems of the primary arithmetic state that:\n\nThus the relation of logical equivalence partitions all primary arithmetic expressions into two equivalence classes: those that simplify to the Cross, and those that simplify to the void.\n\nA1 and A2 have loose analogs in the properties of series and parallel electrical circuits, and in other ways of diagramming processes, including flowcharting. A1 corresponds to a parallel connection and A2 to a series connection, with the understanding that making a distinction corresponds to changing how two points in a circuit are connected, and not simply to adding wiring.\n\nThe primary arithmetic is analogous to the following formal languages from mathematics and computer science:\n\nThe phrase \"calculus of indications\" in LoF is a synonym for \"primary arithmetic\".\n\nA concept peculiar to LoF is that of \"canon\". While LoF does not define canon, the following two excerpts from the Notes to chpt. 2 are apt:\n\nThese excerpts relate to the distinction in metalogic between the object language, the formal language of the logical system under discussion, and the metalanguage, a language (often a natural language) distinct from the object language, employed to exposit and discuss the object language. The first quote seems to assert that the canons are part of the metalanguage. The second quote seems to assert that statements in the object language are essentially commands addressed to the reader by the author. Neither assertion holds in standard metalogic.\n\n"

            "text": "Given any valid primary arithmetic expression, insert into one or more locations any number of Latin letters bearing optional numerical subscripts; the result is a primary algebra formula. Letters so employed in mathematics and logic are called variables. A primary algebra variable indicates a location where one can write the primitive value  or its complement . Multiple instances of the same variable denote multiple locations of the same primitive value.\n\nThe sign '=' may link two logically equivalent expressions; the result is an equation. By \"logically equivalent\" is meant that the two expressions have the same simplification. Logical equivalence is an equivalence relation over the set of primary algebra formulas, governed by the rules R1 and R2. Let \"C\" and \"D\" be formulae each containing at least one instance of the subformula A:\n\nR2 is employed very frequently in primary algebra demonstrations (see below), almost always silently. These rules are routinely invoked in logic and most of mathematics, nearly always unconsciously.\n\nThe primary algebra consists of equations, i.e., pairs of formulae linked by an infix '='. R1 and R2 enable transforming one equation into another. Hence the primary algebra is an equational  formal system, like the many algebraic structures, including Boolean algebra, that are varieties. Equational logic was common before Principia Mathematica (e.g., Peirce,1,2,3 Johnson 1892), and has present-day advocates (Gries and Schneider 1993).\n\nConventional mathematical logic consists of tautological formulae, signalled by a prefixed turnstile. To denote that the primary algebra formula A is a tautology, simply write \"A = \". If one replaces '=' in R1 and R2 with the biconditional, the resulting rules hold in conventional logic. However, conventional logic relies mainly on the rule modus ponens; thus conventional logic is ponential. The equational-ponential dichotomy distills much of what distinguishes mathematical logic from the rest of mathematics.\n\nAn initial is a primary algebra equation verifiable by a decision procedure and as such is not an axiom. LoF lays down the initials:\n\nThe absence of anything to the right of the \"=\" above, is deliberate.\n\nJ2 is the familiar distributive law of sentential logic and Boolean algebra.\n\nAnother set of initials, friendlier to calculations, is:\n\nIt is thanks to C2 that the primary algebra is a lattice. By virtue of J1a, it is a complemented lattice whose upper bound is . By J0,  is the corresponding lower bound and identity element. J0 is also an algebraic version of A2 and makes clear the sense in which  aliases with the blank page.\n\nT13 in LoF generalizes C2 as follows. Any primary algebra (or sentential logic) formula B can be viewed as an ordered tree with branches. Then:\n\nT13: A subformula A can be copied at will into any depth of B greater than that of A, as long as A and its copy are in the same branch of B. Also, given multiple instances of A in the same branch of B, all instances but the shallowest are redundant.\n\nWhile a proof of T13 would require induction, the intuition underlying it should be clear.\n\nC2 or its equivalent is named:\n\nPerhaps the first instance of an axiom or rule with the power of C2 was the \"Rule of (De)Iteration\", combining T13 and AA=A, of C. S. Peirce's existential graphs.\n\nLoF asserts that concatenation can be read as commuting and associating by default and hence need not be explicitly assumed or demonstrated. (Peirce made a similar assertion about his existential graphs.) Let a period be a temporary notation to establish grouping. That concatenation commutes and associates may then be demonstrated from the:\n\nHaving demonstrated associativity, the period can be discarded.\n\nThe initials in Meguire (2011) are AC.D=CD.A, called B1; B2, J0 above; B3, J1a above; and B4, C2. By design, these initials are very similar to the axioms for an abelian group, G1-G3 below.\n\nThe primary algebra contains three kinds of proved assertions:\n\nThe distinction between consequence and theorem holds for all formal systems, including mathematics and logic, but is usually not made explicit. A demonstration or decision procedure can be carried out and verified by computer. The proof of a theorem cannot be.\n\nLet A and B be primary algebra formulas. A demonstration of A=B may proceed in either of two ways:\n\nOnce A=B has been demonstrated, A=B can be invoked to justify steps in subsequent demonstrations. primary algebra demonstrations and calculations often require no more than J1a, J2, C2, and the consequences  (C3 in LoF),  (C1), and AA=A (C5).\n\nThe consequence , C7' in LoF, enables an algorithm, sketched in LoFs proof of T14, that transforms an arbitrary primary algebra formula to an equivalent formula whose depth does not exceed two. The result is a normal form, the primary algebra analog of the conjunctive normal form. LoF (T14–15) proves the primary algebra analog of the well-known Boolean algebra theorem that every formula has a normal form.\n\nLet A be a subformula of some formula B. When paired with C3, J1a can be viewed as the closure condition for calculations: B is a tautology if and only if A and (A) both appear in depth 0 of B. A related condition appears in some versions of natural deduction. A demonstration by calculation is often little more than:\n\nThe last step of a calculation always invokes J1a.\n\nLoF includes elegant new proofs of the following standard metatheory:\n\nThat sentential logic is complete is taught in every first university course in mathematical logic. But university courses in Boolean algebra seldom mention the completeness of 2.\n\nIf the Marked and Unmarked states are read as the Boolean values 1 and 0 (or True and False), the primary algebra interprets 2 (or sentential logic). LoF shows how the primary algebra can interpret the syllogism. Each of these interpretations is discussed in a subsection below. Extending the primary algebra so that it could interpret standard first-order logic has yet to be done, but Peirce's beta existential graphs suggest that this extension is feasible.\n\nThe primary algebra is an elegant minimalist notation for the two-element Boolean algebra 2. Let:\n\nIf join (meet) interprets AC, then meet (join) interprets \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nC\n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n¯\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\overline {{\\overline {A|}}\\ \\ {\\overline {C|}}{\\Big |}}}}\n\n. Hence the primary algebra and 2 are isomorphic but for one detail: primary algebra complementation can be nullary, in which case it denotes a primitive value. Modulo this detail, 2 is a model of the primary algebra. The primary arithmetic suggests the following arithmetic axiomatization of 2: 1+1=1+0=0+1=1=~0, and 0+0=0=~1.\n\nThe set \n\n\n\n \nB\n=\n{\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ B=\\{}\n\n \n\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle ,}\n\n \n\n\n\n \n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\ \\}}\n\n is the Boolean domain or carrier. In the language of universal algebra, the primary algebra is the algebraic structure \n\n\n\n⟨\nB\n,\n−\n \n−\n,\n\n\n\n−\n \n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n \n \n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n⟩\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\langle B,-\\ -,{\\overline {-\\ |}},{\\overline {\\ \\ |}}\\rangle }\n\n of type \n\n\n\n⟨\n2\n,\n1\n,\n0\n⟩\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\langle 2,1,0\\rangle }\n\n. The expressive adequacy of the Sheffer stroke points to the primary algebra also being a \n\n\n\n⟨\nB\n,\n\n\n\n−\n \n−\n \n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n \n \n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n⟩\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\langle B,{\\overline {-\\ -\\ |}},{\\overline {\\ \\ |}}\\rangle }\n\n algebra of type \n\n\n\n⟨\n2\n,\n0\n⟩\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\langle 2,0\\rangle }\n\n. In both cases, the identities are J1a, J0, C2, and ACD=CDA. Since the primary algebra and 2 are isomorphic, 2 can be seen as a \n\n\n\n⟨\nB\n,\n+\n,\n¬\n,\n1\n⟩\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\langle B,+,\\lnot ,1\\rangle }\n\n algebra of type \n\n\n\n⟨\n2\n,\n1\n,\n0\n⟩\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\langle 2,1,0\\rangle }\n\n. This description of 2 is simpler than the conventional one, namely an \n\n\n\n⟨\nB\n,\n+\n,\n×\n,\n¬\n,\n1\n,\n0\n⟩\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\langle B,+,\\times ,\\lnot ,1,0\\rangle }\n\n algebra of type \n\n\n\n⟨\n2\n,\n2\n,\n1\n,\n0\n,\n0\n⟩\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\langle 2,2,1,0,0\\rangle }\n\n.\n\nThe two possible interpretations are dual to each other in the Boolean sense. (In Boolean algebra, exchanging AND ↔ OR and 1 ↔ 0 throughout an equation yields an equally valid equation.) The identities remain invariant regardless of which interpretation is chosen, so the transformations or modes of calculation remain the same; only the interpretation of each form would be different. Example: J1a is . Interpreting juxtaposition as OR and  as 1, this translates to \n\n\n\n¬\nA\n∨\nA\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\neg A\\lor A=1}\n\n which is true. Interpreting juxtaposition as AND and  as 0, this translates to \n\n\n\n¬\nA\n∧\nA\n=\n0\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\neg A\\land A=0}\n\n which is true as well (and the dual of \n\n\n\n¬\nA\n∨\nA\n=\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\neg A\\lor A=1}\n\n).\n\nLet the blank page denote False, and let a Cross be read as Not. Then the primary arithmetic has the following sentential reading:\n\nThe primary algebra interprets sentential logic as follows. A letter represents any given sentential expression. Thus:\n\nThus any expression in sentential logic has a primary algebra translation. Equivalently, the primary algebra interprets sentential logic. Given an assignment of every variable to the Marked or Unmarked states, this primary algebra translation reduces to a primary arithmetic expression, which can be simplified. Repeating this exercise for all possible assignments of the two primitive values to each variable, reveals whether the original expression is tautological or satisfiable. This is an example of a decision procedure, one more or less in the spirit of conventional truth tables. Given some primary algebra formula containing N variables, this decision procedure requires simplifying 2N primary arithmetic formulae. For a less tedious decision procedure more in the spirit of Quine's \"truth value analysis\", see Meguire (2003).\n\nSchwartz (1981) proved that the primary algebra is equivalent — syntactically, semantically, and proof theoretically — with the classical propositional calculus. Likewise, it can be shown that the primary algebra is syntactically equivalent with expressions built up in the usual way from the classical truth values true and false, the logical connectives NOT, OR, and AND, and parentheses.\n\nInterpreting the Unmarked State as False is wholly arbitrary; that state can equally well be read as True. All that is required is that the interpretation of concatenation change from OR to AND. IF A THEN B now translates as  instead of . More generally, the primary algebra is \"self-dual\", meaning that any primary algebra formula has two sentential or Boolean readings, each the dual of the other. Another consequence of self-duality is the irrelevance of De Morgan's laws; those laws are built into the syntax of the primary algebra from the outset.\n\nThe true nature of the distinction between the primary algebra on the one hand, and 2 and sentential logic on the other, now emerges. In the latter formalisms, complementation/negation operating on \"nothing\" is not well-formed. But an empty Cross is a well-formed primary algebra expression, denoting the Marked state, a primitive value. Hence a nonempty Cross is an operator, while an empty Cross is an operand because it denotes a primitive value. Thus the primary algebra reveals that the heretofore distinct mathematical concepts of operator and operand are in fact merely different facets of a single fundamental action, the making of a distinction.\n\nAppendix 2 of LoF shows how to translate traditional syllogisms and sorites into the primary algebra. A valid syllogism is simply one whose primary algebra translation simplifies to an empty Cross. Let A* denote a literal, i.e., either A or \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\overline {A|}}}\n\n, indifferently. Then every syllogism that does not require that one or more terms be assumed nonempty is one of 24 possible permutations of a generalization of Barbara whose primary algebra equivalent is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n∗\n\n\n \nB\n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n \n\nC\n\n∗\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n¯\n\n\n \n\nA\n\n∗\n\n\n \n\nC\n\n∗\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\overline {A^{*}\\ B|}}\\ \\ {\\overline {{\\overline {B|}}\\ C^{*}{\\Big |}}}\\ A^{*}\\ C^{*}}\n\n. These 24 possible permutations include the 19 syllogistic forms deemed valid in Aristotelian and medieval logic. This primary algebra translation of syllogistic logic also suggests that the primary algebra can interpret monadic and term logic, and that the primary algebra has affinities to the Boolean term schemata of Quine (1982: Part II).\n\nThe following calculation of Leibniz's nontrivial Praeclarum Theorema exemplifies the demonstrative power of the primary algebra. Let C1 be \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n¯\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\overline {{\\overline {A|}}{\\Big |}}}}\n\n =A, C2 be \n\n\n\nA\n \n\n\n\nA\n \nB\n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n=\nA\n \n\n\n\nB\n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A\\ {\\overline {A\\ B|}}=A\\ {\\overline {B|}}}\n\n, C3 be \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n \nA\n=\n\n\n\n \n \n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\overline {\\ \\ |}}\\ A={\\overline {\\ \\ |}}}\n\n, J1a be \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n \nA\n=\n\n\n\n \n \n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\overline {A|}}\\ A={\\overline {\\ \\ |}}}\n\n, and let OI mean that variables and subformulae have been reordered in a way that commutativity and associativity permit.\n\nThe primary algebra embodies a point noted by Huntington in 1933: Boolean algebra requires, in addition to one unary operation, one, and not two, binary operations. Hence the seldom-noted fact that Boolean algebras are magmas. (Magmas were called groupoids until the latter term was appropriated by category theory.) To see this, note that the primary algebra is a commutative:\n\nGroups also require a unary operation, called inverse, the group counterpart of Boolean complementation. Let  denote the inverse of a. Let  denote the group identity element. Then groups and the primary algebra have the same signatures, namely they are both \n\n\n\n⟨\n−\n \n−\n,\n\n\n\n−\n \n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n \n \n\n|\n\n\n¯\n\n\n⟩\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\langle -\\ -,{\\overline {-\\ |}},{\\overline {\\ \\ |}}\\rangle }\n\n algebras of type 〈2,1,0〉. Hence the primary algebra is a boundary algebra. The axioms for an abelian group, in boundary notation, are:\n\nFrom G1 and G2, the commutativity and associativity of concatenation may be derived, as above. Note that G3 and J1a are identical. G2 and J0 would be identical if    =    replaced A2. This is the defining arithmetical identity of group theory, in boundary notation.\n\nThe primary algebra differs from an abelian group in two ways:\n\nBoth A2 and C2 follow from B's being an ordered set.\n\n"

Some recursive formulae simplify to the marked or unmarked state. Others \"oscillate\" indefinitely between the two states depending on whether a given depth is even or odd. Specifically, certain recursive formulae can be interpreted as oscillating between true and false over successive intervals of time, in which case a formula is deemed to have an \"imaginary\" truth value. Thus the flow of time may be introduced into the primary algebra.\n\nTurney (1986) shows how these recursive formulae can be interpreted via Alonzo Church's Restricted Recursive Arithmetic (RRA). Church introduced RRA in 1955 as an axiomatic formalization of finite automata. Turney (1986) presents a general method for translating equations of the second degree into Church's RRA, illustrating his method using the formulae E1, E2, and E4 in chapter 11 of LoF. This translation into RRA sheds light on the names Spencer-Brown gave to E1 and E4, namely \"memory\" and \"counter\". RRA thus formalizes and clarifies LoF's notion of an imaginary truth value.\n\n"

His notation was isomorphic to that of LoF: concatenation read as conjunction, and \"non-(X)\" read as the complement of X. Recognition of Leibniz's pioneering role in algebraic logic was foreshadowed by Lewis (1918) and Rescher (1954). But a full appreciation of Leibniz's accomplishments had to await the work of Wolfgang Lenzen, published in the 1980s and reviewed in Lenzen (2004).\n\nCharles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) anticipated the primary algebra in three veins of work:\n\nIronically, LoF cites vol. 4 of Peirce's Collected Papers, the source for the formalisms in (2) and (3) above.\n(1)-(3) were virtually unknown at the time when (1960s) and in the place where (UK) LoF was written. Peirce's semiotics, about which LoF is silent, may yet shed light on the philosophical aspects of LoF.\n\nKauffman (2001) discusses another notation similar to that of LoF, that of a 1917 article by Jean Nicod, who was a disciple of Bertrand Russell's.\n\nThe above formalisms are, like the primary algebra, all instances of boundary mathematics, i.e., mathematics whose syntax is limited to letters and brackets (enclosing devices). A minimalist syntax of this nature is a \"boundary notation\". Boundary notation is free of infix, prefix, or postfix operator symbols. The very well known curly braces ('{', '}') of set theory can be seen as a boundary notation.\n\nThe work of Leibniz, Peirce, and Nicod is innocent of metatheory, as they wrote before Emil Post's landmark 1920 paper (which LoF cites), proving that sentential logic is complete, and before Hilbert and Łukasiewicz showed how to prove axiom independence using models.\n\nCraig (1979) argued that the world, and how humans perceive and interact with that world, has a rich Boolean structure. Craig was an orthodox logician and an authority on algebraic logic.\n\nSecond-generation cognitive science emerged in the 1970s, after LoF was written.

Neither book cites LoF.\n\nThe biologists and cognitive scientists Humberto Maturana and his student Francisco Varela both discuss LoF in their writings, which identify \"distinction\" as the fundamental cognitive act. The Berkeley psychologist and cognitive scientist Eleanor Rosch has written extensively on the closely related notion of categorization.\n\nOther formal systems with possible affinities to the primary algebra include:\n\nThe primary arithmetic and algebra are a minimalist formalism for sentential logic and Boolean algebra. Other minimalist formalisms having the power of set theory include:\n\n"
