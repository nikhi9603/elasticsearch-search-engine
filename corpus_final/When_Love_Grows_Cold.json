            "text": "\n\nWhen Love Grows Cold is a lost[1] 1926 American silent drama film directed by Harry O. Hoyt, and starring Clive Brook and Natacha Rambova in her only screen starring performance. Rambova was chiefly famous for being the wife of Rudolph Valentino.[2] The film was originally titled Do Clothes Make the Woman? But in view of Valentino's recent divorce from Rambova, the distributor took the opportunity to bill her as 'Mrs Valentino' and changed the title to When Love Grows Cold. She was mortally offended and never worked in film again.\n\nOnly bit fragments and a trailer survive of this film.[3][4]\n\n"
