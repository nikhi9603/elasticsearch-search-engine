            "text": "The Internet Broadway Database (IBDB) is an online database of Broadway theatre productions and their personnel. It was conceived and created by Karen Hauser in 1996 and is operated by the Research Department of The Broadway League, a trade association for the North American commercial theatre community.[1]\n\nThis comprehensive history of Broadway provides records of productions from the beginnings of New York theatre in the 18th century up to today. Details include cast and creative lists for opening night and current day, song lists, awards and other interesting facts about every Broadway production.  Other features of IBDB include an extensive archive of photos from past and present Broadway productions, headshots, links to cast recordings on iTunes or Amazon, gross and attendance information.\n\nIts mission was to be an interactive, user-friendly, searchable database for League members, journalists, researchers, and Broadway fans.\n\nThe League recently[when?] added Broadway Touring shows to the database for ease of tracking shows that play in theatres across the country.\n\nIt is managed by Michael Abourizk of the Broadway League.\n\n"
