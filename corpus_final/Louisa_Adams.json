Buchanan, wife of Andrew Buchananand later Nathaniel Frye), Harriet, Catherine, Elizabeth (second wife of United States Senator John Pope of Kentucky), and Adelaide, and a brother, Thomas. In 1778, when Louisa was three years old, her father moved the family to Nantes, France, due to his political views supporting the American Revolution.[3] The family remained there for five years, establishing themselves as a strong social presence among diplomats and ambassadors.[3]\n\nAdams attended a Catholic boarding school as a child until her father's finances forced her and her siblings to leave and be educated by a governess.[4] She became an avid reader excelled in arts and music.\n\n"

Her father had been appointed as United States consul general in 1790, and Adams first visited him in November 1795. Adams at first showed interest in her older sister but soon settled on Louisa. Adams, aged 30, married Louisa, aged 22, on July 26, 1797, at the parish church of All Hallows-by-the-Tower, on Tower Hill. Adams's father, John Adams, then President of the United States, eventually welcomed his daughter-in-law into the family, although they did not meet for several years.[5]\n\nHer parents left Europe in 1797 and went to the U.S. When her father was forced into bankruptcy, President John Adams appointed him as U.S. Director of Stamps. Her father, who suffered from mental illness, died in Frederick, Maryland, in 1802 of severe fever, leaving little provision for his family. Her mother died in September 1811, in her mid-fifties,[6] and is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery.\n\nDuring the course of her marriage, Louisa Adams had fifteen pregnancies, leading to ten miscarriages and four children.[7] The children were:\n\n"

            "text": "Louisa was sickly, and suffered from migraine headaches and frequent fainting spells. She had several miscarriages over the course of her marriage. Having grown up in London and France,  she found Massachusetts dull and provincial, and referred to the Adams family home as being  \"like something out of Noah's Ark\". Nevertheless, she developed a warm affection for her father-in-law, and despite occasional differences, a deep respect for her mother-in-law Abigail Adams,  whom she later described as \"the guiding planet round which we all revolved\".\n\nThree years after their marriage, the couple traveled to Berlin, Prussia, where she got her first taste of diplomacy and the duties of a diplomat's wife.[9]\n\nShe left her two older sons in Massachusetts for education in 1809 when she took two-year-old Charles Francis Adams to Russia, where Adams served as a Minister. Despite the glamour of the tsar's court, she had to struggle with cold winters, strange customs, limited funds, and poor health. An infant daughter born in 1811 died the next year.\n\nPeace negotiations called Adams to Ghent in 1814 and then to London. To join him, she made a forty-day journey across war-ravaged Europe by coach in winter. Roving bands of stragglers and highwaymen filled her with \"unspeakable terrors\" for her son. The next two years gave her an interlude of family life in the country of her birth.\n\nWhen John Quincy Adams was appointed James Monroe's Secretary of State in 1817, the family moved to Washington, D.C. where Louisa's drawing room became a center for the diplomatic corps and other notables. Music enhanced her Tuesday evenings at home, and theater parties contributed to her reputation as an outstanding hostess.\n\n"

Though she continued her weekly \"drawing rooms\", she preferred quiet evenings of reading, composing music and verse, and playing her harp. As First Lady, she became reclusive and depressed. For a time, she regretted ever having married into the Adams family, the men of which she found cold and insensitive. The necessary entertainments were always elegant and her cordial hospitality made the last official reception a gracious occasion although her husband had lost his bid for re-election and partisan feeling still ran high.\n\nIn his diary for June 23, 1828, her husband recorded her \"winding silk from several hundred silkworms that she has been rearing,\" evidently in the White House.[10]\n\nSince 1982 Siena College Research Institute has periodically conducted surveys asking historians to assess American first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president.[11] Consistently, Adams has been ranked in the upper-half of first ladies by historians in these surveys. In terms of cumulative assessment, Adams has been ranked:\n\nIn the 2014 survey, Adams and her husband were also ranked the 19th-highest out of 39 first couples in terms of being a \"power couple\".[14]\n\n"

The untimely deaths of her two oldest sons added to her burdens.\n\n\"Our union has not been without its trials,\" John Quincy Adams conceded. He acknowledged many \"differences of sentiment, of tastes, and of opinions in regard to domestic economy, and to the education of children between us.\"  But added that \"she always has been a faithful and affectionate wife, and a careful, tender, indulgent, and watchful mother to our children.\"\n\n"

The park has a bedspread on display at Peacefield which she made, [21] as well as a painting of her by Edward Savage.
