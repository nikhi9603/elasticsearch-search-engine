In recent years, some agencies have tailored their field structures to meet program needs and facilitate interaction with local, state, and regional counterparts. However, the OMB must still approve any departures.\n\nNote: OMB Circular A-105 was rescinded on June 8, 1995.[10]\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act of 1913 divided the country into twelve districts with a central Federal Reserve Bank in each district. These twelve Federal Reserve Banks together form a major part of the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States. Missouri is the only U.S. state to have two Federal Reserve locations within its borders, but several other states are also divided between more than one district.\n\nThe Federal Circuit is not a regional circuit. Its jurisdiction is nationwide but based on the subject matter.\n\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis defines regions for comparison of economic data.[12]\n\nThe Energy Information Administration currently uses the PADD system established by Petroleum Administration for War in World War II.[13] It is used for data collection on refining petroleum and its products. Each PADD is subdivided into refining districts.\n\nPADD I can also be subdivided into 3 Subdistricts:\n\nThe Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is the research arm of the USDA. The ARS has sectioned their work into five geographic regions:\n\nThe U.S. National Park Service divides the U.S. into the following regions for U.S. National Park purposes:[16][17]\n\nThe U.S. Minor Outlying Islands are not part of any U.S. National Park Service region.\n\n\n\nThe United States Department of Health and Human Services's Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs hosts 10 Regional Offices.[18] Each office oversees a given region.\n\n"
