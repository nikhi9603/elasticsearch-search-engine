In addition to the plaques awarded to the winners, publishers of winning works are honored with certificates, which is unique in the field.[2]\n\nOriginally a poll of Locus subscribers only, voting is now open to anyone, but the votes of subscribers count twice as much as the votes of non-subscribers.[3] The award was inaugurated in 1971, and was originally intended to provide suggestions and recommendations for the Hugo Awards.[2] They have come to be considered a prestigious prize in science fiction, fantasy and horror literature.[4][5] The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction regards the Locus Awards as sharing the reputation of the Hugo and Nebula Awards.[1]\n\nGardner Dozois holds the record for the most wins (43), while Neil Gaiman has won the most awards for works of fiction (18). Robert Silverberg has received the  highest number of nominations (158).[6]\n\n"
