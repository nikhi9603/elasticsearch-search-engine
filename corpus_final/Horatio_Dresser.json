            "text": "Dresser was born January 15, 1866 in Yarmouth, Maine, to Julius and Annetta Seabury Dresser. His parents were involved in the early New Thought movement through their being treated by and then studying with Phineas Parkhurst Quimby. They became his early followers, along with Mary Baker Eddy.[1][2]\n\nAfter Horatio was born, the Dressers moved out west, with Julius Dresser working as a newspaper editor first in Colorado and then California. Horatio left school at 13 to work, and in 1882, the family moved back to Boston.[2] In Boston, Julius Dresser became embroiled in a controversy with Eddy, who by then had founded the Christian Science church. Horatio's father accused Eddy of stealing Quimby's concepts and using them as a basis for her system of Christian Science. Julius also appeared in court on behalf of Edward J. Arens, who had been accused of plagiarizing Eddy and who in his defense unsuccessfully sued Eddy for plagiarizing Quimby.[2][3]\n\nAfter attending local schools, Horatio Dresser was admitted to Harvard in 1891. He dropped out in 1893 upon the death of his father.  Ten years later he returned to Harvard, completing his Ph.D. in 1907.[2]\n\n"

            "text": "In 1895, Dresser became involved with the Metaphysical Club of Boston, a group which he later referred to as the \"first permanent New Thought club\".[4] That same year, Dresser published his first book, The Power of Silence. In 1896, Dresser founded the Journal of Practical Metaphysics. Two years later, this journal was merged into The Arena, for which Dresser was subsequently an associate editor. The following year, 1899, Dresser founded another New Thought magazine, The Higher Law.[2] He was a past president of the International New Thought Alliance.\n\nHe started lecturing about New Thought, speaking to audiences in major cities throughout the country. In 1900 the Atlanta Constitution described him in the following terms:\n\nDresser taught at Ursinus College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from 1911-1913. In 1919, he  became a minister of the General Convention of the Church of the New Jerusalem, a denomination built around the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, briefly serving as a pastor of a Swedenborgian church in Portland, Maine.[2]\n\nDespite never meeting him, Horatio Dresser was a strong advocate of Phineas Parkhurst Quimby. Dresser' sometimes extreme adulation of Quimby led one Quimby acolyte to deduce that Horatio Dresser was actually a reincarnation of Quimby.[6] In 1921, after the Library of Congress made Quimby's papers publicly available, Dresser compiled and edited a selection of Quimby's works, The Quimby Manuscripts (1921). In this work, Dresser re-opened the controversy concerning Quimby and Mary Baker Eddy, and her sources for developing Christian Science. He attacked Eddy in a chapter as well as in the appendix of the book.[7] The work was heavily edited and highly selective, and Dresser chose to only publish what supported his and his parents' claims.[8]\n\nAccording to Ann Taves, \"Dresser used the psychology of the subconscious to reinterpret the writings of Phineas Quimby and provide a unified theoretical foundation for the dissenting mind-cure groups under the banner of New Thought.\"[9] He saw Christian Science and New Thought as linked together in what he called the \"mind cure\" movement, but disliked the public emphasis on Christian Science as opposed to what he saw as the \"more rational\" New Thought; so he wanted to link the origins of \"mind cure\" to Quimby.[10] The complete writings of Quimby were later made available through Boston University, and Gillian Gill writes that they revealed \"only general similarities\" between Quimby's writings and Eddy's.[11]\n\n"
