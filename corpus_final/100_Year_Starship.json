The goal of the main study grant was to create a business plan that fosters the research and technology needed for interstellar travel within 100 years.[1][2][3] The study grant was awarded to a consortium under the lead of the Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence, which led to the foundation of an independent organization with the name 100 Year Starship.[4][5] Annual 100YSS symposia were organized from 2011 to 2015.[6]\n\n"

The new organization maintained the organizational name 100 Year Starship.[13] It was planned that the Dorothy Jemison Foundation for Excellence would team up with Icarus Interstellar, where the latter would work on the technical challenges of 100YSS.[13][14]\n\n"

Papers on many subjects related to interstellar flight and organizational foundations were presented.[10] In 2013 and 2014 symposia were held in Houston,[15] and a fifth in November 2015.[16]\n\n"
