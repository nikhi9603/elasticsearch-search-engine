The first use of \"Haaniidae\" was by Giglio-Tos[1] and it was revived as part of a major revision of mantid taxonomy;[2] genera in the subfamily Haaniinae havie been moved here from the family Thespidae.\n\nThe new placement is in superfamily Haanioidea (of group Cernomantodea) and infraorder Schizomantodea.  Genera in this family have been recorded from: India, Indochina and Malesia through to New Guinea.[3]\n\n"
