For a list of non-Italian produced European Westerns see List of Euro-Western films.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Spaghetti Western genre grew in popularity. Films, particularly those of the influential Dollars trilogy, spawned numerous films of the same ilk and often with similar titles, particularly from the mid to late 1960s and early 1970s. By the end of the 1970s, Spaghetti Westerns had lost their following among mainstream cinema audiences and the production had ground to a virtual halt.\n\n"
