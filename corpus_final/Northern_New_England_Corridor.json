If the 489-mile (787 km) corridor had been completed as proposed in 2000, 110-mile-per-hour (180 km/h) passenger trains would travel from Boston, Massachusetts, to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 4 hours and 31 minutes, and would travel at similar speeds from Boston to Auburn, Maine.\n\nIn 2004, Congress extended the Northern New England High Speed Rail Corridor from Boston to Springfield, Massachusetts, and Albany, New York, and from Springfield to New Haven, Connecticut.[1] The Boston-Springfield-Albany route would provide a link to the Empire Corridor.[2]\n\n"

Service from Boston to Portland takes about 2 hours 30 minutes via the Downeaster.[3] There are no trains to Auburn. Service from Boston to Albany via Springfield takes just over 5 hours on the daily Lake Shore Limited. The New Haven–Springfield Line already allows speeds of up to 110 miles per hour (180 km/h), with end-to-end service taking about 1 hour 20 minutes.\n\n"
