Although there is no present activity on setiQuest per-se, much of the code and raw data products are still available on its successor site.[4]\n\n"

Some of these channels were set up by the community itself, and others were facilitated through the support of several institutions, in cooperation with the SETI Institute.\n\n"

To further this goal, setiQuest was accepted as part of the Google Summer of Code 2011 program.[citation needed]\n\n"

The algorithms used on the ATA currently only search for continuous wave signals (that is, signals that appear at one frequency as a single tone) or pulsed signals.[6] The goal of this participation mode was to allow signal processing enthusiasts to expand the search to other waveforms, perform improvements in the current algorithms or propose innovative new ones.\n\n"

These apps were meant to harness the ability of the human brain to instinctively detect patterns, even in non-trivial cases where automated tools currently fail. The first of such apps, setiQuest Explorer was released in March 2011.[1][7][8]\n\n"
