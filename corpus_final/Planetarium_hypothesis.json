He postulates that we do not see evidence of extraterrestrial life because the universe has been engineered so that it appears empty of other life.[1]\n\n"

            "text": "There is no reliable or reproducible evidence that aliens have visited Earth.[2][3] No transmissions or evidence of intelligent extraterrestrial life have been detected or observed anywhere other than Earth in the Universe. This runs counter to the knowledge that the Universe is filled with a very large number of planets, some of which likely hold the conditions hospitable for life. Life typically expands until it fills all available niches.[4] These contradictory facts form the basis for the Fermi paradox, of which the Planetarium hypothesis is one proposed solution.\n\n"
