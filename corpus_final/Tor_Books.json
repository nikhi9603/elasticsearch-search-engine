They were soon joined by Barbara Doherty and Katherine Pendill, who then composed the original startup team. \n\nTor is a word meaning a rocky pinnacle,[3] as depicted in Tor's logo.[4] Tor Books was sold to St. Martin's Press in 1987. Along with St. Martin's Press; Henry Holt; and Farrar, Straus and Giroux, it became part of the Holtzbrinck group, now part of Macmillan in the US.[5]\n\nIn June 2019, Tor and other Macmillan imprints moved from the Flatiron Building, to larger offices in the Equitable Building.[6][7]\n\n"

Van Vogt's Slan.\n\nTor Teen publishes young-adult novels such as Cory Doctorow's Little Brother and repackages novels such as Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game for younger readers.\n\nTor Labs produces podcasts.[12]\n\nA German sister imprint, Fischer Tor, was founded in August 2016 as an imprint of S. Fischer Verlag (which also belongs to Holtzbrinck Publishing Group).[13] It publishes international titles translated into German, as well as original German works. Fischer Tor also publishes the German online magazine Tor Online, which is based on the same concept as the English Tor.com online magazine, but has its own independent content.[13]\n\n"
