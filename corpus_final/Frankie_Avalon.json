            "text": "Avalon was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,[4] the son of Mary and Nicholas Avallone.[5] His mother was originally from Sicily. His father was a butcher from Naples or Salerno, in Campania, Italy. His paternal grandmother was from Sicily.[6]\n\nIn December 1952, Avalon made his American network television debut playing the trumpet in the Honeymooners \"Christmas Party\" sketch on The Jackie Gleason Show. Two singles showcasing Avalon's trumpet playing were issued on RCA Victor's \"X\" sublabel in 1954.[7]  His trumpet playing was also featured on some of his LP songs as well.  As a teenager he played with Bobby Rydell in Rocco and the Saints.\n\nIn 1959, \"Venus\" (5 weeks No. 1) and \"Why\" went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Why\" was the last No. 1 of the 1950s.\n\nAvalon had 31 charted U.S. Billboard singles from 1958 to late 1962, including \"Just Ask Your Heart\" (U.S. No. 7), \"I'll Wait for You\" (U.S. No. 5), \"Bobby Sox to Stockings\" (U.S. No. 8), and \"A Boy Without a Girl\" (U.S. No. 10). He was less popular in the U.K., but did still manage four chart hits with \"Why\", \"Ginger Bread\", \"Venus\" and \"Don't Throw Away All Those Teardrops\".[8] Most of his hits were written and/or produced by Bob Marcucci, head of Chancellor Records. Avalon concentrated on his acting career which detracted from his recording career, and \"Why\" of 1959 would be Avalon's final top 10 hit.[9]\n\n"

            "text": "  Avalon's first film was a short appearance in Jamboree (1957), playing a trumpet and singing \"Teacher's Pet\".\n\nIn the late 1950s, teen idols were often given roles in films, supporting older male stars in order to attract a younger audience, such as Ricky Nelson in Rio Bravo (1959).  Alan Ladd's daughter was a Frankie Avalon fan, who recommended that he co-star with her father in the Western Guns of the Timberland (1960).[10] Avalon sings two songs, \"The Faithful Kind\" and \"Gee Whiz Whillikins Golly Gee\"; both were released as singles.\n\nLadd announced he would reteam Avalon and his daughter in Six Steps to Freedom but the film was never made.[11]\n\nRushes for Timberland were seen by John Wayne, who was looking for a young actor to play the (fictitious) role of \"Smitty\" in his passion project, The Alamo (1960). Avalon was cast in his second dramatic part.[12] After making the film Wayne told the press \"We're not cutting one bit of any scene in which Frankie appears. I believe he is the finest young talent I've seen in a long time.\"[13] \"Mr Wayne said I was natural as far as acting goes,\" said Avalon.[14] He added, \"My ambition when I was ten years old was to have my own band like Harry James. I never expected anything like this... I'd like to be identified as a singer, dancer, and actor. I don't want to be just one thing.\"[14]\n\n\"I like to appeal to teenagers and adults,\" he said in 1960. \"Everybody\".[15]\n\nAvalon was now in demand as an actor. He provided the singing voice for the lead character in the English-language version of a Japanese musical anime, Alakazam the Great (1960), which was done at the behest of the US distributor, American International Pictures. It was the first in what would be a long association with that company.\n\nFor Irwin Allen, Avalon had a small role and sang the title song in the science fiction adventure film, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961), a solid commercial hit. He had a supporting role in a comedy, Sail a Crooked Ship (1961).\n\nAvalon was teamed with Ray Milland in the science fiction film, Panic in Year Zero! (1962), written by Lou Rusoff. Samuel Z. Arkoff of American International Pictures (AIP) said Avalon and Milland were teamed together because \"they both have particular types of followers and the combination adds up to an attraction.\"[16]\n\nFor AIP, Avalon made a war film with Tab Hunter, Operation Bikini (1963), singing a few songs in flashback. At MGM, he played the lead in an adventure film set in Africa, Drums of Africa (1963).\n\nOf more significance for Avalon's career was a project originally written by Rusoff, Beach Party (1963). This cheerful pop rock-and-roll musical comedy starred Annette Funicello and was directed by William Asher. Arkoff said AIP originally wanted Fabian Forte to co-star with Funicello, but when he proved unavailable, they went with Avalon; it was a big hit and led to several sequels.\n\nAvalon received an offer to appear in a swashbuckler set in 10th century Spain about Fernán González of Castile, The Castilian (1963). This was followed by the Beach Party sequel, Muscle Beach Party (1963), which proved to be popular. Even more so was the third in the film series Bikini Beach (1964), where Avalon had a dual role. In August 1964, Avalon announced he had signed to make ten films in five years for AIP.[17]\n\nPajama Party (1964) was the unofficial fourth film in the series; it was a science fiction spoof in which Avalon ceded the leading man duties to Tommy Kirk, but he did have a cameo in it, however. He was back as the leading man in Beach Blanket Bingo (1965). Avalon later recalled, \"'That's the picture of mine that I think people remember best, and it was just a lot of kids having a lot of fun ... a picture about young romance and about the opposition of adults and old people... It was also fun because we got to learn how to fake skydive out of an airplane.\"[18]\n\nAvalon also appeared in nearly two dozen TV episodes, including ABC's The Bing Crosby Show and The Patty Duke Show, appearing often as himself. Later, he became a national television spokesperson for Sonic Drive-In. In 1965, he appeared in the Combat! TV series episode \"Brother, Brother\" as a childhood friend of Pfc. Kirby, played by Jack Hogan.\n\nAvalon and Tuesday Weld supported Bob Hope in the comedy film, I'll Take Sweden (1965) for Edward Small. For AIP, he teamed with Dwayne Hickman in a copy of Some Like It Hot (1959) called Ski Party (1965). That studio also gave him the lead in a military service comedy, Sergeant Deadhead (1965), playing another dual role. All this activity meant he was reluctant to appear in another \"beach party\" film, so Hickman played the lead in How to Stuff a Wild Bikini (1965), although Avalon had a cameo.\n\nThe box office performance of these last few films was disappointing, especially Sergeant Deadhead, for which sequels had been planned.[19] More popular was AIP's Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine (1965), a comedy with Vincent Price and Hickman. This was liked well enough to justify a sequel, although Avalon did not appear; Fabian Forte took over the Avalon roll.\n\nIn January 1966, Avalon said he no longer wanted to make beach films. \"Even a seagull leaves the beach from time to time, and I'm getting a little sick of sand.\"[20]\n\nAIP tried to find a new starring formula for Avalon, casting him as a stock car driver in Fireball 500 (1966), alongside Fabian and Funicello, for director William Asher. It was a medium financial success and led to other AIP stock car films, though none had Avalon starring in them.\n\nFor Harry Alan Towers he played the lead role in The Million Eyes of Sumuru (1967), and also had a solid role in Skidoo (1968), a comedy from Otto Preminger. In England, he was in AIP's The Haunted House of Horror (1968).\n\n"

In the film, Dee clashes with the record producer and younger singer Caesare, who he feels threatens his career. Eventually, Dee and Caesare quit the label, but their record careers collapse just as the British Invasion begins. The real Fabian threatened a lawsuit, despite the filmmakers' insistence that the film presented only fictional characters (though Marcucci was a paid consultant). Avalon denied most of the film's events.\n\nIn 1980 Avalon appeared in the film Blood Song as Paul Foley, a serial killer. The movie was shot in October-November 1980 in North Bend/Coos Bay, Oregon. It was released in October 1982.[citation needed]\n\nHe also appeared in the Happy Days episode \"Poobah Doo Dah\" playing himself where he sings his hits \"Venus\" and \"Why\".\n\nAvalon had the idea of returning to beach party films with Funicello. He hired several screenwriters and shopped the screenplay around town, eventually managing to set up the project at Paramount Pictures. Back to the Beach (1987) was a moderate success.[21]\n\nIn 1989, Avalon and Funicello appeared as themselves in cameo roles, out jogging the streets in Troop Beverly Hills. Not long afterward Funicello retired, having been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.\n\n"

Additionally, in 2007, he performed \"Beauty School Dropout\" with the four remaining female contenders (Kathleen Monteleone, Allie Schulz, Ashley Spencer, and winner Laura Osnes) for the role of Sandy on the NBC television reality show Grease: You're the One that I Want!\n\nOn April 8, 2009, Avalon performed on American Idol.\n\nAs part of a long-running concert tour, Avalon has toured with fellow Philadelphian early 1960s teen idols Fabian and Bobby Rydell under the banner \"Dick Fox's Golden Boys\".\n\nA cookbook with over 80 recipes from St. Martin's Press, Frankie Avalon's Italian Family Cookbook, was published in 2015.[citation needed]\n\nOn October 18, 2021, Avalon performed on Dancing with the Stars.\n\n"

He told that friend she was the girl he would marry. His agent warned him that marriage would spoil his teen idol mystique, to no avail.\n\nThe Avalons have eight children – Frankie Jr., Tony, Dina, Laura, Joseph, Nicolas, Kathryn and Carla – and ten grandchildren.[citation needed] Frankie Jr. is a former actor who appeared in the original The Karate Kid[23] and is now a musician. Tony, the second-eldest son, plays guitar and taught at the Rock Nation School. Both sons play on tour with their father.[citation needed]\n\n"

The song supposedly is about Daron Malakian's experience in a celebrity baseball game, where he and Avalon were both ignored.[24][25]\n\nAvalon is also mentioned in \"It Takes Two\", a song from the hit musical Hairspray, sung by the character Link Larkin, and in a song by the Wu-Tang Clan called \"The City\" which refers to his experiences of being a big part of the beach party film genre (\"Ride the wave like Frankie Avalon\").\n\nOne of numerous obscure cultural references present in Midway's video game Mortal Kombat 3 was a lo-res image of Frankie Avalon's face that would dart up in the lower right-hand corner of the screen when Goro killed his opponent by knocking him into the spike pit on the Bridge level.\n\nHis song \"Venus\" was featured in Cranium Command (1989–2005), an attraction at Epcot's Wonders of Life Pavilion (now closed) at Walt Disney World. In the attraction, a 12-year-old boy named Bobby (Scott Curtis), tries to survive the pressures of life and falls in love with a beautiful girl named Annie (Natalie Gregory) at school.\n\nAvalon and his song \"Venus\" are mentioned in Wendy Wasserstein's 2005 play Third. The main character, English professor Laurie Jameson, watches a PBS reunion show featuring Avalon singing the song, and sings a line of it to her daughter. In stage productions of the show, part of the song is played and a portion of the supposed PBS special is screened as part of the scenery.\n\nAvalon is also referenced in the 1994 film, The Stöned Age, in which he makes an ending scene cameo appearance.\n\nHis song \"Venus\" additionally appeared in season 4 of the TV series Dexter in which John Lithgow's character, Arthur Mitchell, plays it to remember his deceased sister. Also, \"Venus\" is sampled in Nick Bertke's, single, \"J'Adore Juin\", a mashup of sounds from the movie The Apartment.\n\"Venus\" also appeared in the 2016 film 10 Cloverfield Lane starring John Goodman.\n\nAvalon is also mentioned in The Vaccines' song \"Teenage Icon\".\n\n"
