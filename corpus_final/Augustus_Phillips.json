            "text": "\n\nAugustus Phillips (August 1, 1874 â€“ September 29, 1944), was an American actor. He appeared in 134 films between 1910 and 1921. \n\nAfter 11 years of performing in stock theater, vision problems led Phillips to begin acting in films for the Edison Company on January 1, 1911.[1] He appeared in J. Searle Dawley's 1910 production of Frankenstein, playing Victor Frankenstein, as a young medical student. He was born in Rensselaer, Indiana, and died in London, England.\n\n"
