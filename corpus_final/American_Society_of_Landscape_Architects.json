Langton, Charles N. Lowrie, Warren H. Manning, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., Samuel Parsons, George F. Pentecost Jr., Ossian Cole Simonds, and Downing Vaux.[2] In 1960, the headquarters was moved to Washington, D.C.\n\nThe ASLA bestows various awards annually to professionals and students in the field of landscape architecture for designs and projects. Categories range in size, scale, and type from small residential areas to large parks and waterfronts. Their lifetime achievement award is called the American Society of Landscape Architects Medal.[3]\n\n"
