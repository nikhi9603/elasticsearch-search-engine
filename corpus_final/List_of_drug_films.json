            "text": "\n\nDrug films are films that depict either illicit drug distribution or drug use, whether as a major theme, such as by centering the film around drug subculture or by depicting it in a few memorable scenes. Drug cinema ranges from gritty social realism depictions to the utterly surreal depictions in art film and experimental film.\n\nSome filmmakers create unabashedly pro- or anti-drug works, while others are less judgmental, allowing the viewer to draw their own conclusions. Drugs commonly shown in such films include cocaine, heroin and other opioids, LSD, cannabis (see stoner film) and methamphetamine.\n\nThere is extensive overlap with crime films, which sometimes treat drugs as plot devices to keep the action moving.\n\nThe following is a partial list of drug films and the substances involved.\n\n"
