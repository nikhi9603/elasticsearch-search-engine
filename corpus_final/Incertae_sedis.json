The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, stipulates that \"species and subdivisions of genera must be assigned to genera, and infraspecific taxa must be assigned to species, because their names are combinations\", but ranks higher than the genus may be assigned incertae sedis.[13]\n\n"

This is particularly common when molecular phylogenies are generated, since tissue for many rare organisms is hard to obtain. It is also a common scenario when fossil taxa are included, since many fossils are defined based on partial information. For example, if the phylogeny was constructed using soft tissue and vertebrae as principal characters and the taxon in question is only known from a single tooth, it would be necessary to label it incertae sedis.[5]\n\nIf conflicting results exist or if there is not a consensus among researchers as to how a taxon relates to other organisms, it may be listed as incertae sedis until the conflict is resolved.[5]\n\n"

            "text": "In zoological nomenclature, \"incertae sedis\" is not a nomenclatural term at all per se, but is used by taxonomists in their classifications to mean \"of uncertain taxonomic position\".[2]Glossary In botany, a name is not validly published if it is not accepted by the author in the same publication.[13]Article 36.1 In zoology, a name proposed conditionally may be available under certain conditions.[2]Articles 11 and 15 For uncertainties at lower levels, some authors have proposed a system of \"open nomenclature\", suggesting that question marks be used to denote a questionable assignment.[5] For example, if a new species was given the specific epithet album by Anton and attributed with uncertainty to Agenus, it could be denoted \"Agenus? album Anton (?Anton)\"; the \"(?Anton)\" indicates the author that assigned the question mark.[5] So if Anton described Agenus album, and Bruno called the assignment into doubt, this could be denoted \"Agenus? album (Anton) (?Bruno)\", with the parentheses around Anton because the original assignment (to Agenus) was modified (to Agenus?) by Bruno.[5] This practice is not included in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, and is used only by paleontologists.[5]\n\n"
