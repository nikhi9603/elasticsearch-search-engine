He started at Thanhouser Company in 1911 with She (1911) which is where the majority of his body of work was produced, much of it as the leading man.\n\nAfter leaving Thanhouser in 1916, he worked for several other companies as director and producer, primarily for Paramount Pictures, from 1918 to 1938.\n\nCruze struggled to regain his successes of the silent era when sound came to film. His career declined as he descended further into alcoholism and he ended his directing career at Republic Pictures. He spent the last four years of his life unemployed before he killed himself in 1942.[3]\n\n"
