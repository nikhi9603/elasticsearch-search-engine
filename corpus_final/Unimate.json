            "text": "Unimate was the first industrial robot,[1]\nwhich worked on a General Motors assembly line at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant in Ewing Township, New Jersey, in 1961.[2][3][4]\n\nIt was invented by George Devol in the 1950s using his original patent filed in 1954 and granted in 1961 (U.S. Patent 2,988,237). The patent begins:\n\nDevol, together with Joseph Engelberger, his business associate, started the world's first robot manufacturing company, Unimation.[6]\n\nThe machine undertook the job of transporting die castings from an assembly line and welding these parts on auto bodies, a dangerous task for workers, who might be poisoned by toxic fumes or lose a limb if they were not careful.[4]\n\nThe original Unimate consisted of a large computer-like box, joined to another box and was connected to an arm, with systematic tasks stored in a drum memory.\n\n\nThe Unimate also appeared on The Tonight Show hosted by Johnny Carson on  which it knocked a golf ball into a cup, poured a beer, waved the orchestra conductor's baton and grasped an accordion and waved it around.[6][7]\n\nIn 2003 the Unimate was inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame.[8]\n\n"
