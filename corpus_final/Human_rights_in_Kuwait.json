Most notably, Kuwait's handling of the stateless Bedoon crisis has come under substantial criticism from international human rights organisations and the United Nations.[1][2][3] Kuwait has the largest number of stateless people in the entire region.[2][3] Kuwait also faces significant criticism for the human rights violations against foreign nationals, women, and LGBT people. Although Kuwaiti law (including the Constitution of Kuwait) theoretically pledges to protect all human rights; the enforcement mechanisms designed to help protect human rights are very limited in Kuwait.\n\n"

            "text": "Kuwait has the largest number of stateless people in the entire region.[5] Most stateless Bedoon of Kuwait belong to the northern tribes, especially the Al-Muntafiq tribal confederation.[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] A minority of stateless Bedoon in Kuwait belong to the 'Ajam community.[14]\n\nUnder the terms of the Kuwait Nationality Law 15/1959, all the Bedoon in Kuwait are eligible for Kuwaiti nationality by naturalization.[15] In practice, it is widely believed that Sunnis of Persian descent or tribal Saudis can readily achieve Kuwaiti naturalization whilst Bedoon of Iraqi tribal ancestry cannot.[16] As a result, many Bedoon in Kuwait feel pressured to hide their background.[17]\n\nFrom 1965 until 1985, the Bedoon were treated as Kuwaiti citizens and guaranteed citizenship: they had free access to education, health care and all the other privileges of citizenship.[2] The stateless Bedoon constituted 80-90% of the Kuwaiti Army in the 1970s and 1980s until the Gulf War.[18]\n\nIn 1985 at the height of the Iran–Iraq War, the Bedoon were reclassified as \"illegal residents\" and denied Kuwaiti citizenship and its accompanying privileges.[2][18][19] The Iran–Iraq War threatened Kuwait's internal stability and the authorities feared the sectarian background of the stateless Bedoon.[18] The Bedoon issue in Kuwait “overlaps with historic sensitivities about Iraqi influence inside Kuwait”, with many of those denied Kuwaiti nationality being believed to have originated from Iraq.[20]\n\nIn 1985, the then emir, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, escaped an assassination attempt.[21][22] After the assassination attempt, the government changed the Bedoon's status from that of legal residents to illegal residents.[18] By 1986, the Bedoon were fully excluded from the same social and economic rights as Kuwaiti citizens.\n\nSince 1986, the Kuwaiti government has refused to grant any form of documentation to the Bedoon, including birth certificates, death certificates, identity cards, marriage certificates, and driving licences. The Bedoon also face many restrictions in employment, travel and education. They are not permitted to educate their children in state schools and universities.\n\nIn 1995, Human Rights Watch reported that there were 300,000 stateless Bedoon, and this number was formally repeated by the British government.[23][24]\n\nAccording to several human rights organizations, the State of Kuwait is committing ethnic cleansing and genocide against the stateless Bedoon.[3][10] The Kuwaiti Bedoon crisis resembles the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar.[15] In 1995, it was reported in the British parliament that the Al Sabah ruling family had deported 150,000 stateless Bedoon to refugee camps in the Kuwaiti desert near the Iraqi border with minimal water, insufficient food and no basic shelter, and that they were threatened with death if they returned to their homes in Kuwait City.[24][13] As a result, many of the stateless Bedoon fled to Iraq, where they remain stateless people even today.[25][26] The Kuwaiti government also stands accused of attempting to falsify their nationalities in official state documents.[27] There have been reports of forced disappearances and mass graves of Bedoon.[3][28][29][30][31][32][13]\n\nThe 1995 Human Rights Watch report stated:\n\nBritish MP George Galloway stated:\n\nBy 2004, the Bedoon accounted for only 40% of the Kuwaiti Army, a major reduction from their presence in the 1970s and 1980s.[33] In 2013, the UK government estimated that there were 110,729 \"documented\" Bedoon in Kuwait, without giving a total estimate, but noting that all stateless individuals in Kuwait remain at risk of persecution and human rights breaches.[34] The Bedoon are generally categorized into three groups: stateless tribespeople, stateless police/military and the stateless children of Kuwaiti women who married Bedoon men.[18] According to the Kuwaiti government, there are only 93,000 \"documented\" Bedoon in Kuwait.[34] In 2018, the Kuwaiti government claimed that it would naturalize up to 4,000 stateless Bedoon per year but this is considered unlikely.[16][35] In 2019, the Iranian embassy in Kuwait announced that it offers Iranian citizenship to stateless Bedoon of Iranian ancestry.[36][37]\n\nIn recent years, the rate of suicide among Bedoon has risen sharply.[2]\n\nThe State of Kuwait formally has an official Nationality Law that grants non-nationals a legal pathway to obtaining citizenship.[38] However, as access to citizenship in Kuwait is autocratically controlled by the Al Sabah ruling family it is not subject to any external regulatory supervision.[39][38] The naturalization provisions within the Nationality Law are arbitrarily implemented and lack transparency.[38][39] The lack of transparency prevents non-nationals from receiving a fair opportunity to obtain citizenship.[1][39] Consequently, the Al Sabah ruling family have been able to manipulate naturalization for politically motivated reasons.[39][40][41][42][43][1][44][45][46] In the three decades after independence in 1961, the Al Sabah ruling family naturalized hundreds of thousands of foreign Bedouin immigrants predominantly from Saudi Arabia.[42][47][39][44][40][45][41][1][46][48] By 1980, as many as 200,000 immigrants were naturalized in Kuwait.[47] Throughout the 1980s, the Al Sabah's politically motivated naturalization policy continued.[47][39] The naturalizations were not regulated nor sanctioned by Kuwaiti law.[39][40][42][48] The exact number of naturalizations is unknown but it is estimated that up to 400,000 immigrants were unlawfully naturalized in Kuwait.[48][42] The foreign Bedouin immigrants were mainly naturalized to alter the demographic makeup of the citizen population in a way that made the power of the Al Sabah ruling family more secure.[43][39][40][42] As a result of the politically motivated naturalizations, the number of naturalized citizens exceeds the number of Bedoon in Kuwait.[1] The Al Sabah ruling family actively encouraged foreign Bedouin immigrants to migrate to Kuwait.[47] The Al Sabah ruling family favored naturalizing Bedouin immigrants because they were considered loyal to the ruling family, unlike the politically active Palestinian, Lebanese, and Syrian expats in Kuwait.[47] The naturalized citizens were predominantly Sunni Saudi immigrants from southern tribes.[46][42][40] Accordingly, none of the stateless Bedoon in Kuwait belong to the Ajman tribe.[40]\n\nThe Kuwaiti judicial system's lack of authority to rule on citizenship further complicates the Bedoon crisis, leaving Bedoon no access to the judiciary to present evidence and plead their case for citizenship.[1] Although non-nationals constitute 70% of Kuwait's total population the Al Sabah ruling family persistently denies citizenship to most non-nationals, including those who fully satisfy the requirements for naturalization as stipulated in the state's official Nationality Law. According to unofficial estimates, 60-80% of Kuwait's Bedoon are Shia Muslims[49][50][51][8][52][53] and, as a result, it is widely believed that the Bedoon issue in Kuwait is sectarian in nature.[49][51][50][54][8][55][52] The Kuwaiti authorities permit the forgery of hundreds of thousands of politically motivated naturalizations[1][48] whilst simultaneously denying citizenship to the Bedoon.[1][48] The politically motivated naturalizations were noted by the United Nations, political activists, scholars, researchers and even members of the Al Sabah family.[1][39][40][42][43][41][56][44][47][45][48] It is widely considered a form of deliberate demographic engineering and has been likened to Bahrain's politically motivated naturalization policy.[39][43][46] Within the GCC countries, politically-motivated naturalization policies are referred to as \"political naturalization\" (التجنيس السياسي).[39]\n\nA large number of stateless Bedoon regularly immigrate to Europe as asylum seekers. The United Kingdom is the most popular destination for Bedoom asylum seekers. According to the Home Office, Kuwait is the eighth largest source of asylum seekers crossing the English Channel on small boats.[57][58][59]\n\n"

The kafala system leaves foreign nationals prone to exploitation. Administrative deportation is very common in Kuwait for minor offenses, including minor traffic violations. Kuwait is one of the world's worst offenders in human trafficking. Hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals are subjected to numerous human rights abuses including inhumane conditions of involuntary servitude by employers in Kuwait. They are subjected to physical and sexual abuse, non-payment of wages, poor work conditions, threats, confinement to the home, and withholding of passports to restrict their freedom of movement.[68][69]\n\nRepeated abusers include M A Al-Kharafi & Sons and its subsidiary Kharafi National that have been cited by human rights organizations and the United States Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Kuwait.[70][71][72] Many human rights organizations have accused Kuwait of apartheid policies toward foreign nationals. Kuwait is considered one of the most xenophobic countries in the world.\n\nIn 2018, there was a diplomatic crisis between Kuwait and the Philippines due to the mistreatment of Filipino workers in Kuwait. There are roughly 241,000 Filipinos in Kuwait. Most are migrant workers,[73] and approximately 60% of Filipinos in Kuwait are employed as domestic workers. In July 2018, Kuwaiti fashionista Sondos Alqattan released a controversial video criticising domestic workers from the Philippines. Many of her clients were quick to denounce her.[74]\n\nIn 2020, there was a diplomatic crisis between Kuwait and Egypt due to the mistreatment of Egyptian workers in Kuwait.[75] In November 2021, Egyptian foreign worker Samih Maurice Bowles filed official complaints against Kuwait in front of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment for torture, forced disappearance, arbitrary detention, and other human rights abuses.[76]\n\n"

Children born to a Kuwaiti mother and non-Kuwaiti father do not get Kuwaiti citizenship, unless a decree is passed by the Minister of Interior.[80]\n\nKuwait's position in international rankings has varied over the years. In 2014, Kuwait was ranked 113 of 142 globally in the Global Gender Gap Report,[81][82] the country improved its ranking due to significant increases in the overall income indicator. In 2015, Kuwait was ranked 117 of 145 globally in the Global Gender Index.[83] In 2020, Kuwait was ranked 122 of 153 globally in the Global Gender Gap Report. Regarding the GGGR subindex, Kuwait ranked 142 of 152 on political empowerment 143 of 153 on health and survival, 120 of 153 on economic opportunity, and 57 of 153 on educational attainment.[84] In 2021, Kuwait was ranked 143 of 156 globally in the Global Gender Gap Report.[85] Regarding the GGGR subindex, Kuwait ranked 153 of 156 on political empowerment, 94 of 156 on health and survival, 137 of 156 on economic opportunity, and 59 of 156 on educational attainment.[85] In 2013, 53% of Kuwaiti women participated in the labor force.[86] Kuwaiti women outnumber men in the workforce.[87]\n\n"
