            "text": "Length contraction is the phenomenon that a moving object's length is measured to be shorter than its proper length, which is the length as measured in the object's own rest frame.[1] It is also known as Lorentz contraction or Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction (after Hendrik Lorentz and George Francis FitzGerald) and is usually only noticeable at a substantial fraction of the speed of light. Length contraction is only in the direction in which the body is travelling. For standard objects, this effect is negligible at everyday speeds, and can be ignored for all regular purposes, only becoming significant as the object approaches the speed of light relative to the observer.\n\n"

            "text": "Length contraction was postulated by George FitzGerald (1889) and Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1892) to explain the negative outcome of the Michelson–Morley experiment and to rescue the hypothesis of the stationary aether (Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction hypothesis).[2][3]\nAlthough both FitzGerald and Lorentz alluded to the fact that electrostatic fields in motion were deformed (\"Heaviside-Ellipsoid\" after Oliver Heaviside, who derived this deformation from electromagnetic theory in 1888), it was considered an ad hoc hypothesis, because at this time there was no sufficient reason to assume that intermolecular forces behave the same way as electromagnetic ones. In 1897 Joseph Larmor developed a model in which all forces are considered to be of electromagnetic origin, and length contraction appeared to be a direct consequence of this model. Yet it was shown by Henri Poincaré (1905) that electromagnetic forces alone cannot explain the electron's stability. So he had to introduce another ad hoc hypothesis: non-electric binding forces (Poincaré stresses) that ensure the electron's stability, give a dynamical explanation for length contraction, and thus hide the motion of the stationary aether.[4]\n\nEventually, Albert Einstein (1905) was the first[4] to completely remove the ad hoc character from the contraction hypothesis, by demonstrating that this contraction did not require motion through a supposed aether, but could be explained using special relativity, which changed the notions of space, time, and simultaneity.[5] Einstein's view was further elaborated by Hermann Minkowski, who demonstrated the geometrical interpretation of all relativistic effects by introducing his concept of four-dimensional spacetime.[6]\n\n"

            "text": "First it is necessary to carefully consider the methods for measuring the lengths of resting and moving objects.[7] Here, \"object\" simply means a distance with endpoints that are always mutually at rest, i.e., that are at rest in the same inertial frame of reference. If the relative velocity between an observer (or his measuring instruments) and the observed object is zero, then the proper length \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{0}}\n\n of the object can simply be determined by directly superposing a measuring rod. However, if the relative velocity > 0, then one can proceed as follows:\n\nThe observer installs a row of clocks that either are synchronized a) by exchanging light signals according to the Poincaré–Einstein synchronization, or b) by \"slow clock transport\", that is, one clock is transported along the row of clocks in the limit of vanishing transport velocity. Now, when the synchronization process is finished, the object is moved along the clock row and every clock stores the exact time when the left or the right end of the object passes by. After that, the observer only has to look at the position of a clock A that stored the time when the left end of the object was passing by, and a clock B at which the right end of the object was passing by at the same time. It's clear that distance AB is equal to length \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n of the moving object.[7] Using this method, the definition of simultaneity is crucial for measuring the length of moving objects.\n\nAnother method is to use a clock indicating its proper time \n\n\n\n\nT\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T_{0}}\n\n, which is traveling from one endpoint of the rod to the other in time \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T}\n\n as measured by clocks in the rod's rest frame. The length of the rod can be computed by multiplying its travel time by its velocity, thus \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n0\n\n\n=\nT\n⋅\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{0}=T\\cdot v}\n\n in the rod's rest frame or \n\n\n\nL\n=\n\nT\n\n0\n\n\n⋅\nv\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L=T_{0}\\cdot v}\n\n in the clock's rest frame.[8]\n\nIn Newtonian mechanics, simultaneity and time duration are absolute and therefore both methods lead to the equality of \n\n\n\nL\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nL\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle L_{0}}\n\n. Yet in relativity theory the constancy of light velocity in all inertial frames in connection with relativity of simultaneity and time dilation destroys this equality. In the first method an observer in one frame claims to have measured the object's endpoints simultaneously, but the observers in all other inertial frames will argue that the object's endpoints were not measured simultaneously. In the second method, times \n\n\n\nT\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T}\n\n and \n\n\n\n\nT\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle T_{0}}\n\n are not equal due to time dilation, resulting in different lengths too.\n\nThe deviation between the measurements in all inertial frames is given by the formulas for Lorentz transformation and time dilation (see Derivation). It turns out that the proper length remains unchanged and always denotes the greatest length of an object, and the length of the same object measured in another inertial reference frame is shorter than the proper length. This contraction only occurs along the line of motion, and can be represented by the relation\n\nwhere\n\nReplacing the Lorentz factor in the original formula leads to the relation\n\nIn this equation both L and L0 are measured parallel to the object's line of movement. For the observer in relative movement, the length of the object is measured by subtracting the simultaneously measured distances of both ends of the object. For more general conversions, see the Lorentz transformations. An observer at rest observing an object travelling very close to the speed of light would observe the length of the object in the direction of motion as very near zero.\n\nThen, at a speed of 13400000 m/s (30 million mph, 0.0447c) contracted length is 99.9% of the length at rest; at a speed of 42300000 m/s (95 million mph, 0.141c), the length is still 99%. As the magnitude of the velocity approaches the speed of light, the effect becomes prominent.\n\n"

            "text": "The principle of relativity (according to which the laws of nature are invariant across inertial reference frames) requires that length contraction is symmetrical: If a rod rests in inertial frame S, it has its proper length in S and its length is contracted in S'. However, if a rod rests in S', it has its proper length in S' and its length is contracted in S. This can be vividly illustrated using symmetric Minkowski diagrams, because the Lorentz transformation geometrically corresponds to a rotation in four-dimensional spacetime.[9][10]\n\n"

            "text": "Magnetic forces are caused by relativistic contraction when electrons are moving relative to atomic nuclei. The magnetic force on a moving charge next to a current-carrying wire is a result of relativistic motion between electrons and protons.[11][12]\n\nIn 1820, André-Marie Ampère showed that parallel wires having currents in the same direction attract one another. In the electrons' frame of reference, the moving wire contracts slightly, causing the protons of the opposite wire to be locally denser.  As the electrons in the opposite wire are moving as well, they do not contract (as much). This results in an apparent local imbalance between electrons and protons; the moving electrons in one wire are attracted to the extra protons in the other. The reverse can also be considered.  To the static proton's frame of reference, the electrons are moving and contracted, resulting in the same imbalance. The electron drift velocity is relatively very slow, on the order of a meter an hour but the force between an electron and proton is so enormous that even at this very slow speed the relativistic contraction causes significant effects.\n\nThis effect also applies to magnetic particles without current, with current being replaced with electron spin.[citation needed]\n\n"

So length contraction cannot be measured in the object's rest frame, but only in a frame in which the observed object is in motion. In addition, even in such a non-co-moving frame, direct experimental confirmations of length contraction are hard to achieve, because at the current state of technology, objects of considerable extension cannot be accelerated to relativistic speeds. And the only objects traveling with the speed required are atomic particles, yet whose spatial extensions are too small to allow a direct measurement of contraction.\n\nHowever, there are indirect confirmations of this effect in a non-co-moving frame:\n\n"

He presented the following thought experiment: Let A'B' and A\"B\" be the endpoints of two rods of the same proper length L0, as measured on x' and x\" respectively. Let them move in opposite directions along the x* axis, considered at rest, at the same speed with respect to it. Endpoints A'A\" then meet at point A*, and B'B\" meet at point B*. Einstein pointed out that length A*B* is shorter than A'B' or A\"B\", which can also be demonstrated by bringing one of the rods to rest with respect to that axis.[22]\n\n"

This could suggest that if one could take a picture of a fast moving object, that the image would show the object contracted in the direction of motion. However, such visual effects are completely different measurements, as such a photograph is taken from a distance, while length contraction can only directly be measured at the exact location of the object's endpoints. It was shown by several authors such as Roger Penrose and James Terrell that moving objects generally do not appear length contracted on a photograph.[23] This result was popularized by Victor Weisskopf in a Physics Today article.[24] For instance, for a small angular diameter, a moving sphere remains circular and is rotated.[25] This kind of visual rotation effect is called Penrose-Terrell rotation.[26]\n\n"

This is the Euclidean analog of boosting a cuboid in E1,2.  In the latter case, however, we can interpret the boosted cuboid as the world slab of a moving plate.\n\nImage: Left: a rotated cuboid in three-dimensional euclidean space E3. The cross section is longer in the direction of the rotation than it was before the rotation. Right: the world slab of a moving thin plate in Minkowski spacetime (with one spatial dimension suppressed) E1,2, which is a boosted cuboid. The cross section is thinner in the direction of the boost than it was before the boost. In both cases, the transverse directions are unaffected and the three planes meeting at each corner of the cuboids are mutually orthogonal (in the sense of E1,2 at right, and in the sense of E3 at left).\n\nIn special relativity, Poincaré transformations are a class of affine transformations which can be characterized as the transformations between alternative Cartesian coordinate charts on Minkowski spacetime corresponding to alternative states of inertial motion (and different choices of an origin).  Lorentz transformations are Poincaré transformations which are linear transformations (preserve the origin). Lorentz transformations play the same role in Minkowski geometry (the Lorentz group forms the isotropy group of the self-isometries of the spacetime) which are played by rotations in euclidean geometry.  Indeed, special relativity largely comes down to studying a kind of noneuclidean trigonometry in Minkowski spacetime, as suggested by the following table:\n\n"
