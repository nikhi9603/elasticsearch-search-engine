            "text": "In March 2010, the staff of the magazine issued an open letter attacking new editor Li Chang for actions including: cancelling contracts with Chinese science fiction readers and authors; refusing to buy stories from authors, forcing the editors to write the stories themselves; ordering that foreign language editors do all translations into Chinese themselves instead of buying translations, and art editors create the illustrations themselves instead of hiring artists.  He also interfered with advertising, replacing the magazine's front cover with an advertisement for a school. All of these malfeasances were claimed as causes for the recent severe drop in SFW circulation, to a low of approximately 130,000.[6][7][8] Investigations by China Youth Daily and others verified the accusations,[9] and by 4 April Xinhua reported Li Chang's ouster.[10] Later the problem was solved, and Yao Haijun became the deputy director of Science Fiction World.[11]\n\n"
