            "text": "\n\nMonura is an extinct suborder of wingless insects in the order Archaeognatha. They resembled their modern relatives, the silverfish, and had a single lengthy filament projecting from the end of the abdomen. They also had a pair of leg-like cerci and some non-ambulatory abdominal appendages. The largest specimens reached 30 millimetres (1.2Â in) or more, not counting the length of the filament.[1]\n\n"
