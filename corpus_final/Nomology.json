            "text": "\"Nomology\" derives from the Greek νόμος, law, and λόγος, reason. The term nomology may come from Aristotle.[1] The '-ology' suffix implies 'order', 'word' and 'reason', and is about being subjectively reasonable or 'logical' as in sociology and psychology. The 'nom-' part implies 'rule' and 'law', and is about being objectively lawful or 'nomic' as in economics.\n\n"

            "text": "The nomology of mind is the branch of science and philosophy concerned with the laws or principles governing the thought processes and operation of the mind, especially as defined by custom or culture.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, it was described as one of two grand divisions of philosophy, the other being metaphysics,[2] for example:\n\nA nomological approach requires taking account of both subjective and objective aspects in a decision. Nomology provides the framework for building a nomological network of relationships between constructs in decision making.[4]\n\n"
