            "text": "The past tense is a grammatical tense whose function is to place an action or situation in the past. Examples of verbs in the past tense include the English verbs sang, went and washed. Most languages have a past tense, with some having several types in order to indicate how far back the action took place. Some languages have a compound past tense which uses auxiliary verbs as well as an imperfect tense which expresses continuous or repetitive events or actions. Some languages inflect the verb, which changes the ending to indicate the past tense, while non-inflected languages may use other words, such as \"yesterday\" or \"last week\" etc to indicate that something took place in the past.\n\n"

            "text": "In some languages, the grammatical expression of past tense is combined with the expression of other categories such as grammatical aspect (see tense–aspect). Thus a language may have several types of past tense form, their use depending on what aspectual or other additional information is to be encoded. French, for example, has a compound past (passé composé) for expressing completed events, and imperfect for continuous or repetitive events.\n\nSome languages that grammaticalise for past tense do so by inflecting the verb, while others do so periphrastically using auxiliary verbs, also known as \"verbal operators\" (and some do both, as in the example of French given above). Not all languages grammaticalise verbs for past tense – Mandarin Chinese, for example, mainly uses lexical means (words like \"yesterday\" or \"last week\") to indicate that something took place in the past, although use can also be made of the tense/aspect markers le and guo.\n\nThe \"past time\" to which the past tense refers generally means the past relative to the moment of speaking, although in contexts where relative tense is employed (as in some instances of indirect speech) it may mean the past relative to some other time being under discussion.[1] A language's past tense may also have other uses besides referring to past time; for example, in English and certain other languages, the past tense is sometimes used in referring to hypothetical situations, such as in condition clauses like If you loved me ..., where the past tense loved is used even though there may be no connection with past time.\n\nSome languages grammatically distinguish the recent past from remote past with separate tenses.  There may be more than two distinctions.\n\nIn some languages, certain past tenses can carry an implication that the result of the action in question no longer holds. For example,  in the Bantu language Chichewa, use of the remote past tense ánáamwalíra \"he died\" would be surprising since it would imply that the person was no longer dead.[2] This kind of past tense is known as discontinuous past. Similarly certain imperfective past tenses (such as the English \"used to\") can carry an implication that the action referred to no longer takes place.[3]\n\nA general past tense can be indicated with the glossing abbreviation PST.\n\n"

            "title": "Indo-European languages",
            "text": "The European continent is heavily dominated by Indo-European languages, all of which have a past tense. In some cases the tense is formed inflectionally as in English see/saw or walks/walked and as in the French imperfect form,  and sometimes it is formed periphrastically, as in the French passé composé form. Further, all of the non-Indo-European languages in Europe, such as Basque, Hungarian, and Finnish, also have a past tense.\n\nIn English, the past tense (or preterite) is one of the inflected forms of a verb. The past tense of regular verbs is made by adding -d or -ed to the base form of the verb, while those of irregular verbs are formed in various ways (such as see→saw, go→went, be→was/were). With regular and some irregular verbs, the past tense form also serves as a past participle. For full details of past tense formation, see English verbs.\n\nPast events are often referred to using the present perfect construction, as in I have finished (also known as present in past). However this is not regarded as an instance of the past tense; instead it is viewed as a combination of present tense with perfect aspect, specifying a present state that results from past action.[4] (It can be made into a past tense form by replacing the auxiliary have with had; see below.)\n\nVarious multi-word constructions exist for combining past tense with progressive (continuous) aspect, which denotes ongoing action; with perfect aspect; and with progressive and perfect aspects together. These and other common past tense constructions are listed below.\n\nFor details of the usage of the various constructions used to refer to the past, see Uses of English verb forms. Note that the past tense is also used in referring to some hypothetical situations, not necessarily connected with past time, as in if I tried or I wish I knew. (For the possible use of were in place of was in such instances, see English subjunctive.)\n\nGerman uses three forms for the past tense.\n\nIn southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the preterite is mostly used solely in writing, for example in stories. Use in speech is regarded as snobbish and thus very uncommon. South German dialects, such as the Bavarian dialect, as well as Yiddish and Swiss German, have no preterite (with the exception of sein and wollen), but only perfect constructs.\n\nIn certain regions, a few specific verbs are used in the preterite, for instance the modal verbs and the verbs haben (have) and sein (be).\n\nIn speech and informal writing, the Perfekt is used (e.g., Ich habe dies und das gesagt. (I said this and that)).\n\nHowever, in the oral mode of North Germany, there is still a very important difference between the preterite and the perfect, and both tenses are consequently very common. The preterite is used for past actions when the focus is on the action, whilst the present perfect is used for past actions when the focus is on the present state of the subject as a result of a previous action. This is somewhat similar to the English usage of the preterite and the present perfect.\n\nThe past perfect is used in every German speaking country and it is used to place an action in the past before another action in the past. It is formed with an auxiliary (haben/sein) and a past participle that is placed at the end of the clause.\n\nDutch mainly uses these two past tenses:\n\nLess common is the voltooid verleden tijd, which corresponds to the English past perfect. It is formed by combining an onvoltooid verleden form of zijn (\"to be\") or hebben (\"to have\") with the notional verb, for example: Ik was daar voor gisteren al geweest. This means \"I had been there before yesterday.\" This tense is used to indicate that one action in the past occurred before another past action, and that the action was fully finished before the second action took place.\n\nIn non-Germanic Indo-European languages, past marking is typically combined with a distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect, with the former reserved for single completed actions in the past. French for instance, has an imperfect tense form similar to that of German but used only for past habitual or past progressive contexts like \"I used to...\" or \"I was doing...\". Similar patterns extend across most languages of the Indo-European family right through to the Indic languages.\n\nUnlike other Indo-European languages, in Slavic languages tense is independent of aspect, with imperfective and perfective aspects being indicated instead by means of prefixes, stem changes, or suppletion. In many West Slavic and East Slavic languages, the early Slavic past tenses have largely merged into a single past tense. In both West and East Slavic, verbs in the past tense are conjugated for gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and number (singular, plural).\n\nFrench has numerous forms of the past tense including but not limited to:\n\nPortuguese and Spanish have several forms of the past tense, which include but are not limited to:\n\nA difference between the pluperfect occurs between Portuguese and Spanish; in the former, a synthetic pluperfect exists which follows the imperfect conjugations, but -ra replaces the -va seen in the verb endings.\n\n"

            "text": "While in Semitic languages tripartite non-past/past imperfective/past perfective systems similar to those of most Indo-European languages are found, in the rest of Africa past tenses have very different forms from those found in European languages. Berber languages have only the perfective/imperfective distinction and lack a past imperfect.\n\nMany non-Bantu Niger–Congo languages of West Africa do not mark past tense at all \nbut instead have a form of perfect derived from a word meaning \"to finish\". Others, such as Ewe, distinguish only between future and non-future.\n\nIn complete contrast, Bantu languages such as Zulu have not only a past tense, but also a less remote proximal tense which is used for very recent past events and is never interchangeable with the ordinary past form. These languages also differ substantially from European languages in coding tense with prefixes instead of such suffixes as English -ed.\n\nOther, smaller language families of Africa follow quite regional patterns. Thus the Sudanic languages of East Africa and adjacent Afro-Asiatic families are part of the same area with inflectional past-marking that extends into Europe, whereas more westerly Nilo-Saharan languages often do not have past tense.\n\n"

Languages in East Asia and Southeast Asia typically do not distinguish tense; in Mandarin Chinese, for example, the particle 了le when used immediately after a verb instead indicates perfective aspect.\n\nIn parts of islands in Southeast Asia, even less distinction is made, for instance in Indonesian and some other Austronesian languages. Past tenses, do, however, exist in most Oceanic languages.\n\n"

Some of these tenses can have specialised mythological significance and uses.\n\nA number of Native American languages like Northern Paiute stand in contrast to European notions of tense because they always use relative tense, which means time relative to a reference point that may not coincide with the time an utterance is made.\n\n"

(Ai wen si om \"I saw him\"; Ai bin klin ap mai ples for da halade \"I cleaned up my place for the holiday\"; De haed plei BYU laes wik \"They played BYU last week\").
