These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behaviour, and or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.\n\nThe word \"robot\" was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920. The term \"robotics\" was coined by Isaac Asimov in his 1941 science fiction short-story \"Liar!\"[1]\n\n"
