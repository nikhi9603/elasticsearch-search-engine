He became a student of the movement in 1863, after seeking healing from its founder, Phineas Parkhurst Quimby. He was the founder of a mind-cure sanitarium in Salisbury, Massachusetts, and has been referred to as \"the recording angel of metaphysics\".[1]\n\n"

            "text": "Evans became a Methodist minister in 1838, serving eleven different charges until 1863. That year he left the Methodists and joined the Church of the New Jerusalem after reading the books of Emanuel Swedenborg.\n\nIn 1863 Evans went to Portland, Maine, to find healing in the philosophy and methods of Phineas P. Quimby. Soon after, with Quimby's permission, he opened a mental medicine office in Claremont, New Hampshire. He and his wife opened an office in Boston. They practiced and informally taught the principles of mental healing there for 20 years.[4][5]\n\nCharles S. Braden, a metaphysical historian, wrote that Evans, \"was the only important figure, aside from Mrs. Eddy, who attempted to work out a consistent and philosophically supported system of metaphysical healing and mental healing after Quimby.\"[1]\n\n"
