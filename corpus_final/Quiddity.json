The question \"what (quid) is it?\" asks for a general description by way of commonality. This is quiddity or \"whatness\" (i.e., its \"what it is\"). Quiddity was often contrasted by the scholastic philosophers with the haecceity or \"thisness\" of an item, which was supposed to be a positive characteristic of an individual that caused it to be this individual, and no other. It is used in this sense in British poet George Herbert's poem, \"Quiddity\".\n\n"
