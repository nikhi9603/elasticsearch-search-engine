Mr Tonning took a film where the objects were seen moving. The movie was analyzed by the ufological organization Ground Saucer Watch (GSW). According to the GSW: there is no evidence of a hoax; the motion of the objects was attributable to the camera movement caused by the photographer; there is a lack of reference points in the photos or video tape, so it is not possible to give a conclusive answer on the nature of the objects.[1] Other experts identified the bright objects as Jupiter and Arcturus.[2]\n\n"

The bright, green, shining orb was traveling with great speed in night sky and was described by witnesses as much bigger than an aircraft. The police and coast guards were contacted by hundreds of people who saw the object. Some people believed, and the newspapers half-seriously claimed, that it was a UFO, and for a while it remained an unidentified flying object. A few days later, the phenomenon was explained to have been a bolide.\n\n"
