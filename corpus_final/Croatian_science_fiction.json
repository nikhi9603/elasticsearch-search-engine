Liburnicon is held in Opatija, a seaside town situated under the Uƒçka mountain on the shore of northern Adriatic.\n\nThe first Liburnicon was held in 2006, under the name Abbacon. It was a gathering of several dozen science fiction and fantasy fans from Opatija and the surrounding region. Initially, Liburnicon was conceived as a small summer convention in the Liburnia region, and over time it developed into a festival that also offers musical, artistic, and excursion content.\n\n"
