The United States is the third most populous country in the world.[12] The Census Bureau showed a population increase of 0.12% for the twelve-month period ending in July 2021,[13] below the world average annual rate of 0.9%.[14] The total fertility rate in the United States estimated for 2021 is 1.664 children per woman,[15] which is below the replacement fertility rate of approximately 2.1.\n\nThe U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century – at a growth rate of about 1.3% a year – from about 76 million in 1900 to 281 million in 2000.[16] It is estimated to have reached the 200 million mark in 1967, and the 300 million mark on October 17, 2006.[16][17] Foreign-born immigration caused the U.S. population to continue its rapid increase, with the foreign-born population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 45 million in 2015,[18] representing one-third of the population increase.[19] The U.S. population grew by 1.6 million from 2018 to 2019, with 38% of growth from immigration.[20] Population growth is fastest among minorities as a whole, and according to the Census Bureau's estimation for 2020, 50% of U.S. children under the age of 18 are members of ethnic minority groups.[21]\n\nAs of 2020, white people (including Hispanic whites) numbered 204,277,273 or 61.6% of the population and Non-Latino whites make up 57.8% of the country's population.[22]\n\nLatino Americans accounted for 51.1% of the total national population growth between 2010 and 2020, increasing from 50.5 million in 2010 to 62.1 million in 2020.[23] The Hispanic or Latino population increased by 23% between 2010 and 2020, an increase of more than 11.6 million.[23] Immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants are expected to provide most of the U.S. population gains in the decades ahead.[24]\n\nIn 2020, it was reported that 51.0% of births were to non-Hispanic white mothers.[25] In 2021, the percentage increased to 51.5%.[25][26]\n\nThe 12 month ending general fertility rate increased from 56.6 to 57.0 in 2022 Q1 compared to 2021 Q4.[27]\n\n"

[13]\n\nIn 1800 the average U.S. woman had 7.04 children;[34] by the first decade of the 1900s, this number had already decreased to 3.56.[35] Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.72 children per woman in 2018.[36]\n\nThe drop in the U.S. fertility rate from 2.08 per woman in 2007 to 1.76 in 2017 was mostly due to the declining birth rate of Hispanics, teenagers, and young women, although the birth rate for older women rose.[37]\n\nThe dependency ratio is the age-population ratio of people who are normally not in the labor force (the dependent population, which includes those aged 0 to 14 and 65 and older) to those who are (the productive part ages 15 to 64). It is used to gauge the strain on the populace that is productive.\n\n*Ratios are ranked from highest to lowest by country\n\nThe average life expectancy in the United States has been on a decline since 2014. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cites three main reasons: a 72% increase in overdoses in the last decade (including a 30% increase in opioid overdoses from July 2016 to September 2017, but did not differentiate between accidental overdose with a legal prescription and overdose with opioids obtained illegally and/or combined with illegal drugs i.e., heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, etc.), a ten-year increase in liver disease (the rate for men age 25 to 34 increased by 8% per year; for women, by 11% per year), and a 33% increase in suicide rates since 1999.[41]\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to approximately 61% of the decrease in life expectancy in the United States.[42] While increases in mortality from unintentional injuries, heart disease, homicide, and diabetes contributed to 11.7%, 5.8%, 2.9%, and 2.8% of the decrease in life expectancy from 2019 to 2020, respectively.[42] Life expectancy has also varied by racial and ethnic group, with Non-Hispanic Asians having the highest life expectancy and Non-Hispanic American Indians having the lowest.[42] In 2021, life expectancy at birth in the United States fell for the second year in a row, the first two-year drop since 1961-1963.[43]\n\nNOTE: Life expectancy at birth data for 2021 are provisional.*\n\nThe most densely populated state is New Jersey (1,263/mi2 or 488/km2).\n\nThe population is highly urbanized, with 82.3% of the population residing in cities and suburbs.[2] Large urban clusters are spread throughout the eastern half of the United States (particularly the Great Lakes area, northeast, east, and southeast) and the western tier states; mountainous areas, principally the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian chain, deserts in the southwest, the dense boreal forests in the extreme north, and the central prairie states are less densely populated; Alaska's population is concentrated along its southern coast – with particular emphasis on the city of Anchorage – and Hawaii's is centered on the island of Oahu.[2] California and Texas are the most populous states, as the mean center of U.S. population has consistently shifted westward and southward.[47][48] New York City is the most populous city in the United States[49] and has been since at least 1790.\n\nIn the U.S. territories, population centers include the San Juan metro area in Puerto Rico,[50] Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands,[51] and the island of Tutuila in American Samoa.[52]\n\nNote: Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number. Also note that growth arrows indicate an increase or decrease in the number of births, not in the fertility rate.[53][54][55][56]\n\nNOTE:\n\nIn 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents (including many eligible to become citizens), 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants.[58] Among current living immigrants to the U.S., the top five countries of birth are Mexico (25% of immigrants), China (6%), India (6%), the Philippines (5%) and El Salvador (3%). Some 13% of current living immigrants come from Europe and Canada, and 10% from the Caribbean.[58] Among new arrivals, Asian immigrants have been more numerous than Hispanic immigrants since 2010; in 2017, 37.4% of immigrant arrivals were Asian, and 26.6% were Hispanic.[58] Until 2017 and 2018, the United States led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[59] From fiscal year 1980 until 2017, 55% of refugees came from Asia, 27% from Europe, 13% from Africa, and 4% from Latin America, fleeing war and persecution.[59]\n\n*(mid-year estimates) \n\nAs of 2017, 13.6% (44.4 million) of the population was foreign born – an increase from 4.7% in 1970 but less than the 1890 record of 14.8%. 45% of the foreign born population were naturalized US citizens. 23% (10.3 million) of the foreign born community is undocumented, accounting for 3.2% of the total population.[58] According to the 2010 census, Latin America and the Caribbean is the largest region-of-birth group, accounting for 53% of the foreign born population. As of 2018 this region is still the largest source of immigrants to the United States[61][62][63] In 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and U.S. born children of immigrants (second-generation Americans) in the United States, accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population.[64] In 2018, 1,096,611 immigrants were granted either permanent or temporary legal residence in the United States[65]\n\n"

Among non-Hispanic white women, no states had a fertility rate above the replacement level. Among non-Hispanic Black women, 12 states reached above the replacement level needed. Among Hispanic women, 29 states did.[98] For non-Hispanic white women, the highest total fertility rate was in Utah, at 2.099, and the lowest in the District of Columbia, at 1.012. Among non-Hispanic Black women, the highest total fertility rate was in Maine, at 4.003, and the lowest in Wyoming, at 1.146. For Hispanic women, the highest total fertility rate was in Alabama, at 3.085, and the lowest in Vermont, at 1.200, and Maine, at 1.281.[98][99] Due to the aging and low birth rates among white people, deaths now outnumber births among white people (non-Hispanic) in more than half the states in the country.[100]\n\nIn 2018, U.S. births fell to the lowest level in 32 years.[101]\n\nMedian age of the U.S. population through history.

Since the 2000 census, Congress has authorized people to identify themselves according to more than one racial classification by selecting more than one category. Only one ethnicity may be selected, however, because the U.S. Census recognizes only two ethnicities – Hispanic and Non-Hispanic – which are mutually exclusive since you can be one or the other, but not both.

People who identify with the terms \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" are those who classify themselves in one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the decennial census questionnaire and various Census Bureau survey questionnaires – \"Mexican, Mexican Am., Chicano\" or \"Puerto Rican\" or \"Cuban\" – as well as those who indicate that they are \"another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin.\"[127] People who identify their origin as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race.[116]\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, decennial census of population, 1970 (5-percent\nsample), 1980 to 2020.[102]\n\nSource: United States Census Bureau.[119]\n\nSource: United States Census Bureau.[119]\n\nNote: Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race.\n\nAs of 2017, there are 2,098,763 American Indian and Alaska Native people in the United States,[118] representing 0.7% of the U.S. population. There are 573 federally recognized tribal governments[128] in the United States. As of 2000, the largest groups in the United States by population were Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, Sioux, Chippewa, Apache, Blackfeet, Iroquois, and Pueblo.\n\nThere were 22.1 million veterans in 2009,[129] meaning that less than 10% of Americans served in the Armed Forces.[130]\n\nIn 2010, The Washington Post estimated that there were 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country.[131] As of 2017, Pew Research reported that there an estimated 10.5 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S.[132]\n\nThere were about 2 million people in prison in 2010.[133]\n\nA report by the U.S. Census Bureau projects a decrease in the ratio of Whites between 2010 and 2050, from 79.5% to 74.0%.[135] At the same time, Non-Hispanic Whites are projected to no longer make up a majority of the population by 2045, but will remain the largest single ethnic group. In 2050 they will compose 46.3% of the population. Non-Hispanic whites made up 85% of the population in 1960.[136] However, white Americans overall are still projected to make up over 70% of the population in 2050.\n\nThe report foresees the Hispanic or Latino population rising from 16% today to 30% by 2050, the Black percentage barely rising from 13.2% to 14.4%, and Asian Americans upping their 4.6% share to 7.8%. The United States had a population of 310 million people in October 2010, and is projected to reach 400 million by 2039 and 439 million in 2050.[137][138][139][140] It is further projected that 82% of the increase in population from 2005 to 2050 will be due to immigrants and their children.[141]\n\nOf the nation's children in 2050, 62% are expected to be of a minority ethnicity, up from 44% today. Approximately 39% are projected to be Hispanic or Latino (up from 22% in 2008), and 38% are projected to be single-race, non-Hispanic Whites (down from 56% in 2008).[142] Racial and ethnic minorities surpassed non-Hispanic whites as the largest group of U.S. children under 5 years old in 2015.[143]\n\nThe United Nations projects a population of just over 400 million in 2060.[144]\n\nThe country's racial profile will be vastly different, and although whites will remain the single largest ethnic group in the U.S., they will no longer be a majority excluding White Hispanics by 2055 according to Pew Research Center. Growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations is predicted to almost triple over the next 40 years. By 2055, the breakdown is estimated to be 48% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, 16% Black, and 14% Asian.[144]\n\nAs of 2015[update], 14% of the United States' population is foreign born, compared to just 5% in 1965. Nearly 39 million immigrants have come to the U.S. since 1965, with most coming from Asia and Latin America. The 2015 Census Report predicts that the percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born will continue to increase, reaching 19% by 2060. This increase in the foreign-born population will account for a large share of the overall population growth.[144]\n\nThe average person in the U.S. of 2060 is likely to be older than the average person of 2018 today, and almost one in four people will be 65 or older.[144]\n\nNote: \"Minority\" refers to people who reported their ethnicity and race as something other than non-Hispanic White alone in the decennial census.\n\n"

If this current growth rate continues, by 2050, around 51% of Americans will not have a religion.[159]\n\nSurveys conducted in 2014 and 2019 by Pew indicated that the percentage of Americans unaffiliated with a religion increased from 16% in 2007 to 23% in 2014 and 26% of the population in 2019.[160][161]\n\nAccording to statistical data made by the Pew Research Center in 2021 about 63% of the US population is Christian, 28% is Unaffiliated, 2% is Jewish, 1% is Buddhist, 1% follows Islam and 3% follow other religions such as Hinduism, traditional religions and others. Currently, the United States has the largest Christian population in the world (approximately 230-250 million) and the largest Protestant Christian population (approximately 150-160 million). The country also has the second largest Jewish community in the world (after Israel) and the largest Buddhist and Hindu communities in the West, as well as the largest number of followers of Islam in North America. The country has about 64 million non-affiliates (only China and Japan have more).[citation needed][162]\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center study released in 2018, by 2040, Islam will surpass Judaism to become the second largest religion in the US due to higher immigration and birth rates.[188]\n\nThe United States government does not collect religious data in its census. The survey below, the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone survey of 54,461 American residential households in the contiguous United States. The 1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281.\n\nAdult respondents were asked the open-ended question, \"What is your religion, if any?\". Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was \"Protestant\" or \"Christian\" further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one-third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions.\n\nReligious Self-Identification of the U.S. Adult Population: 1990, 2001, 2008[189]Figures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect refusals are possibly more representative of \"no religion\" than any other group.\n\n"

            "title": "Generational cohorts",
            "text": "A definitive recent study of US generational cohorts was done by Schuman and Scott (2012) in which a broad sample of adults of all ages was asked, \"What world events are especially important to you?\"[197] They found that 33 events were mentioned with great frequency. When the ages of the respondents were correlated with the expressed importance rankings, seven (some put 8 or 9) distinct cohorts became evident.\n\nToday the following descriptors are frequently used for these cohorts:\n\nSubdivided groups are present when peak boom years or inverted peak bust years are present, and may be represented by a normal or inverted bell-shaped curve (rather than a straight curve). The boom subdivided cohorts may be considered as \"pre-peak\" (including peak year) and \"post-peak\". The year 1957 was the baby boom peak with 4.3 million births and 122.7 fertility rate. Although post-peak births (such as trailing edge boomers) are in decline, and sometimes referred to as a \"bust\", there are still a relatively large number of births. The dearth-in-birth bust cohorts include those up to the valley birth year, and those including and beyond, leading up to the subsequent normal birth rate. The baby boom began around 1943 to 1946.[citation needed]\n\nFrom the decline in U.S. birth rates starting in 1958 and the introduction of the birth control pill in 1960, the Baby Boomer normal distribution curve is negatively skewed. The trend in birth rates from 1958 to 1961 show a tendency to end late in the decade at approximately 1969, thus returning to pre-WWII levels, with 12 years of rising and 12 years of declining birth rates. Pre-war birth rates were defined as anywhere between 1939 and 1941 by demographers such as the Taeuber's, Philip M. Hauser and William Fielding Ogburn.[204]\n\n"

            "text": "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2021, the population of the United States grew at a slower rate than in any other year since the country's founding.[205] The U.S. population grew only 0.1% from the previous year before.[205] The United States' population has grown by less than one million people for the first time since 1937, with the lowest numeric growth since at least 1900, when the Census Bureau began yearly population estimates.[205] Apart from the previous few years, when population growth plummeted to historically low levels, the slowest pace of increase in the twentieth century occurred between 1918 and 1919, when the influenza epidemic and World War I were both in full swing.[205] Slower population growth has been the norm in the United States for some years, owing to lower fertility and net international migration, as well as rising mortality from an aging population.[205]\n\nTo put it another way, since the mid-2010s, births and net international migration have been dropping while deaths have risen. These trends have a cumulative effect of reduced population increase.[205]\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this trend, resulting in a historically slow population increase in 2021.\n\nThe growth rate is 0.1% as estimated for 2021.[205]\n\nThe birth rate is 11.0 births/1,000 population, as of 2020.[38] This was the lowest birth rate since records began. There were 3,613,647 births in 2020, this was the lowest number of births since 1980.[38]\n\nIn 2020, the CDC reported that there were 1,676,911 marriages in 2020, compared to 2019, there were 2,015,603 marriages.[206] Marriage rates varied significantly by state, ranging from 3.2 marriages/1,000 population in California to 21.0 marriages/1,000 population in Nevada.*[207]\n\n*Rates are based on provisional counts of marriages by state of occurrence\n\nIn 2009, Time magazine reported that 40% of births were to unmarried women.[208] The following is a breakdown by race for unwed births: 17% Asian, 29% White, 53% Hispanics (of any race), 66% Native Americans, and 72% Black American.[209]\n\nAccording to the CDC, in 2020, there were at least, 1,461,121 births to unmarried women. In 2020, 40.5% of births were to unmarried women. The following is breakdown by race for unwed births: 28.4% Non-Hispanic White, 70.4% Non-Hispanic Black, and 52.8% Hispanic (of any race).[210]\n\nThe drop in the birth rate from 2007 to 2009 is believed to be associated with the Great Recession.[211]\n\nA study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that more than half (51 percent) of live hospital births in 2008 and 2011 were male.[212]\n\nPer U.S. federal government data released in March 2011, births fell 4% from 2007 to 2009, the largest drop in the U.S. for any two-year period since the 1970s.[213]\nBirths have declined for three consecutive years, and are now 7% below the peak in 2007.[214] This drop has continued through 2010, according to data released by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics in June 2011.[214] Numerous experts have suggested that this decline is largely a reflection of unfavorable economic conditions.[215] This connection between birth rates and economic downturns partly stems from the fact that American birth rates have now fallen to levels that are comparable to the Great Depression of the 1930s.[216] Teen birth rates in the U.S. are at the lowest level in U.S. history.[217] In fact, teen birth rates in the U.S. have consistently decreased since 1991 through 2011, except for a brief increase between 2005 and 2007.[217] The other aberration from this otherwise steady decline in teen birth rates is the 6% decrease in birth rates for 15- to 19-year-olds between 2008 and 2009.[217] Despite these years of decrease, U.S. teen birth rates are still higher than in other developed nations.[217] Racial differences prevail with teen birth and pregnancy rates as well. The American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Black teen pregnancy rates are more than double the non-Hispanic white teen birth rate.[218]\n\n\nFor those interested in a look at where the U.S. population is headed over a longer term, the link below to a recent article offers a preliminary overview of census trends. Yes, a multi-racial democracy awaits, if we can keep it, but also a society with significant demographic pitfalls. Here is a quote summarizing key points:\nAs of July 2020[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 10.2 percent (U3 rate).\n\nAs of July 2019[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 3.7 percent (U3 rate).\n\nAs of July 2018[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 3.7 percent (U3 rate).\n\nAs of July 2017[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.3 percent (U3 rate).[221]\n\nAs of July 2016[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.9 percent (U3 rate).[221]\n\nAs of July 2015[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 5.3 percent (U3 rate).[222]\n\nAs of July 2014[update], the U.S. unemployment rate was 6.2 percent (U3 rate).[221]\n\nThe U6 unemployment rate as of April 2017[update] was 8.6 percent.[223] The U6 unemployment rate counts not only people without work seeking full-time employment (the more familiar U3 rate), but also counts \"marginally attached workers and those working part-time for economic reasons.\" Note that some of these part-time workers counted as employed by U6 could be working as little as an hour a week. And the \"marginally attached workers\" include those who have become discouraged and stopped looking, but still want to work. The age considered for this calculation is 16 years and over.\n\nUrban Americans have more job opportunities than those in more rural areas. From 2008 to 2018, 72% of the nation's employment growth occurred in cities with more than one million residents, which account for 56% of the overall population.[224]\n\nIn 2021, 27.1 million Americans said they were living in a different place than a year before, compared to 29.8 million in 2020. This reflects an 8.4% mover rate, the lowest recorded in more than 70 years.[225]\n\n"
