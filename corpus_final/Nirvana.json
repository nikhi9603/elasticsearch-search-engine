            "text": "The ideas of spiritual liberation, with the concept of soul and Brahman, appears in Vedic texts and Upanishads, such as in verse 4.4.6 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.[15]\n\nThe term nirvana in the soteriological sense of \"blown out, extinguished\" state of liberation appears at many places in Vedas particularly in Bhagavata Purana, however populist opinion does not give credit to either the Vedas or the Upanishads. Erroneously Collins states, \"the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it nirvana.\"[16] This may have been deliberate use of words in early Buddhism, suggests Collins, since Atman and Brahman were described in Vedic texts and Upanishads with the imagery of fire, as something good, desirable and liberating.[17] Collins says the word nirvāṇa is from the verbal root vā \"blow\" in the form of past participle vāna \"blown\", prefixed with the preverb nis meaning \"out\". Hence the original meaning of the word is \"blown out, extinguished\". (Sandhi changes the sounds: the v of vāna causes nis to become nir, and then the r of nir causes retroflexion of the following n: nis+vāna > nirvāṇa).[18] However the Buddhist meaning of nirvana also has other interpretations.\n\nL. S. Cousins said that in popular usage nirvana was \"the goal of Buddhist discipline,... the final removal of the disturbing mental elements which obstruct a peaceful and clear state of mind, together with a state of awakening from the mental sleep which they induce.\"[19]\n\n"

            "text": "Nirvāṇa is a term found in the texts of all major Indian religions – Hinduism,[20] Jainism[21] Buddhism,[22] and Sikhism.[23][24] It refers to the profound peace of mind that is acquired with moksha, liberation from samsara, or release from a state of suffering, after respective spiritual practice or sādhanā.[note 2]\n\nThe liberation from Saṃsāra developed as an ultimate goal and soteriological value in the Indian culture, and called by different terms such as nirvana, moksha, mukti and kaivalya. This basic scheme underlies Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, where \"the ultimate aim is the timeless state of moksa, or, as the Buddhists first seem to have called it, nirvana.\"[28] Although the term occurs in the literatures of a number of ancient Indian traditions, the concept is most commonly associated with Buddhism.[web 1] Some writers believe the concept was adopted by other Indian religions after it became established in Buddhism, but with different meanings and description, for instance the use of (Moksha) in the Hindu text Bhagavad Gita of the Mahabharata.[20]\n\nThe idea of moksha is connected to the Vedic culture, where it conveyed a notion of amrtam, \"immortality\",[29][30] and also a notion of a timeless, \"unborn\", or \"the still point of the turning world of time\". It was also its timeless structure, the whole underlying \"the spokes of the invariable but incessant wheel of time\".[note 3] The hope for life after death started with notions of going to the worlds of the Fathers or Ancestors and/or the world of the Gods or Heaven.[29][note 4]\n\nThe earliest Vedic texts incorporate the concept of life, followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit).[31] However, the ancient Vedic Rishis challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and either permanent heaven or permanent hell is disproportionate. The Vedic thinkers introduced the idea of an afterlife in heaven or hell in proportion to one's merit, and when this runs out, one returns and is reborn.[32][33][34] The idea of rebirth following \"running out of merit\" appears in Buddhist texts as well.[35] This idea appears in many ancient and medieval texts, as  Saṃsāra, or the endless cycle of life, death, rebirth and redeath, such as section 6:31 of the Mahabharata[36] and verse 9.21 of the Bhagavad Gita.[37][38][note 5] The Saṃsara, the life after death, and what impacts rebirth came to be seen as dependent on karma.[41]\n\n"

            "text": "The most ancient texts of Hinduism such as the Vedas and early Upanishads don't mention the soteriological term Nirvana.[20] This term is found in texts such as the Bhagavad Gita[20] and the Nirvana Upanishad, likely composed in the post-Buddha era.[58] The concept of Nirvana is described differently in Buddhist and Hindu literature.[59] Hinduism has the concept of Atman – the soul, self[60][61][62] – asserted to exist in every living being, while Buddhism asserts through its anatman doctrine that there is no Atman in any being.[63][64] Nirvana in Buddhism is \"stilling mind, cessation of desires, and action\" unto emptiness, states Jeaneane Fowler, while nirvana in post-Buddhist Hindu texts is also \"stilling mind but not inaction\" and \"not emptiness\", rather it is the knowledge of true Self (Atman) and the acceptance of its universality and unity with Brahman.[59]\n\nThe ancient soteriological concept in Hinduism is moksha, described as the liberation from the cycle of birth and death through self-knowledge and the eternal connection of Atman (soul, self) and metaphysical Brahman. Moksha is derived from the root muc* (Sanskrit: मुच्) which means free, let go, release, liberate; Moksha means \"liberation, freedom, emancipation of the soul\".[65][66] In the Vedas and early Upanishads, the word mucyate (Sanskrit: मुच्यते)[65] appears, which means to be set free or release - such as of a horse from its harness.\n\nThe traditions within Hinduism state that there are multiple paths (Sanskrit: marga) to moksha: jnana-marga, the path of knowledge; bhakti-marga, the path of devotion; and karma-marga, the path of action.[67]\n\nThe term Brahma-nirvana appears in verses 2.72 and 5.24-26 of the Bhagavad Gita.[68] It is the state of release or liberation; the union with the Brahman.[6] According to Easwaran, it is an experience of blissful egolessness.[69]\n\nAccording to Zaehner, Johnson and other scholars, nirvana in the Gita is a Buddhist term adopted by the Hindus.[20] Zaehner states it was used in Hindu texts for the first time in the Bhagavad Gita, and that the idea therein in verse 2.71-72 to \"suppress one's desires and ego\" is also Buddhist.[20] According to Johnson the term nirvana is borrowed from the Buddhists to confuse the Buddhists, by linking the Buddhist nirvana state to the pre-Buddhist Vedic tradition of metaphysical absolute called Brahman.[20]\n\nAccording to Mahatma Gandhi, the Hindu and Buddhist understanding of nirvana are different because the nirvana of the Buddhists is shunyata, emptiness, but the nirvana of the Gita means peace and that is why it is described as brahma-nirvana (oneness with Brahman).[70]\n\n"
