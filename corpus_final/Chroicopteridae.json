The name is derived from first use, for subfamily Chroicopterinae, by Giglio-Tos[1] and it has been revived as part of a major revision of mantid taxonomy.[2]  Some genera have also been moved here from the tribe Rivetinini, with others placed elsewhere including the subfamily Miomantinae.\n\nThe new placement is as a sole family in the superfamily Chroicopteroidea (of group Cernomantodea) and infraorder Schizomantodea.  Genera in this family have been recorded from Africa and islands in the Atlantic and Indian oceans.[3]\n\n"
