On this strategy, societies would strive to delay the development of harmful technologies and their applications, while accelerating the development of beneficial technologies, especially those that offer protection against the harmful ones.[1][2]\n\n"

            "text": "Paul Christiano believes that while accelerating technological progress appears to be one of the best ways to improve human welfare in the next few decades, a faster rate of growth cannot be equally important for the far future because growth must eventually saturate due to physical limits. Hence, from the perspective of the far future, differential technological development appears more crucial.[5][unreliable source?]\n\nInspired by Bostrom's proposal, Luke Muehlhauser and Anna Salamon suggested a more general project of \"differential intellectual progress\", in which society advances its wisdom, philosophical sophistication, and understanding of risks faster than its technological power.[6][unreliable source?][7][unreliable source?] Brian Tomasik has expanded on this notion.[8][unreliable source?]\n\n"
