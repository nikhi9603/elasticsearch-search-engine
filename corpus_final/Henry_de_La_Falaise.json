            "text": "James Henry de La Falaise was born on February 11, 1898 in  Saint-Cyr-l'École, France, the eldest son and second child of Louis Gabriel Venant Le Bailly de La Falaise, Écuyer (1866–1910), a three time Olympic gold-medallist in fencing and former Army officer.[1] His mother was the former Henriette Frédérique Hennessy (1873–1965), scion of the Cognac family.[2][3] After his father died in 1910, his widowed mother married her second husband, Count Antoine Hocquart de Turtot (1872–1954), a cavalry officer and major French horse-racing figure, in 1912. His mother and father had four children together:\n\nHis mother had another child with her second husband, de La Falaise's half-sibling\n\nThe title held by the head of the family, Marquis de La Coudraye, dating from 1707, was granted, by an 1876 act of succession, to the younger son of Pacôme-François Le Bailly, Seigneur de La Falaise, and his wife, Pauline-Louise-Victoire de Loynes, daughter of the Marquis de La Coudraye. La Falaise inherited the title of Marquis de La Coudraye from his paternal grandfather, Gabriel-César-Henri Le Bailly de La Falaise, who, like his father, died in 1910 (the father died on April 4, the grandfather on August 6).\n\nSince La Falaise had no children, the title of Marquis de La Coudraye was inherited by his younger brother, Alain de La Falaise (died 1977). It then passed to his nephew, Alexis de La Falaise (died 2004). It is now held by his grand-nephew (grandson of Alain), Daniel de La Falaise, a professional chef and food writer.\n\nHis actual surname was Le Bailly, though he and other members of his family used Le Bailly de La Falaise, referring to an ancestral estate; it is typically abbreviated to de La Falaise. As the marquis told The New York Times (October 7, 1925), \"My patronymic name is Le Bailly, but ... I use the name de la Falaise because it is one of the great-grandfather branches of the Le Bailly family. De La Falaise is the only existing branch of that family today. So this should be my entire name: James Henry Le Bailly de La Falaise, Marquis de La Coudraye\".\n\n"

            "text": "The Marquis de La Coudraye was awarded the Croix de Guerre for heroism during World War I, during which time he was attached to the 70th Division of the American Expeditionary Forces.[6] He received Croix de Guerre for bravery during World War II, while he was attached to the British 12th Royal Lancers. In 1943, La Falaise published \"Through Hell to Dunkirk\" (Military Service Publishing Company), a memoir of his war experiences.[7]\n\nNotably handsome and universally known as \"Hank,\" the marquis was admiringly described by the actress Lillian Gish as \"a real war hero. In his bathing-suit he presents a graphic picture of what modern warfare does to a man – he is so cut-and-shot and covered with scars.\"[citation needed]\n\n"

            "text": "La Falaise directed at least five motion pictures, notably among them are two travelogue drama silent films about primitive life and customs: Kliou, the Killer (1934, released 1936, also known as Kliou, the Killer Tiger) although the disparity in the titling remains unknown even today,[8] and Legong: Dance of the Virgins (1933, released 1935, also known as Djanger: Love Rite of Bali).[9][10] The latter production was described many years later as a \"seductive blend of serious documentary, lyrical effusion and unbridled prurience\".[11] He may also have written a film script for Gloria Swanson, his first wife, called Paris Luck, a 1927 work that bore the name of Robert Bailly. He also served as the U.S. representative for Pathé, the French film studio.[12] They were the last mainstream silent films shot by a major Hollywood studio.[13]\n\nLa Falaise also produced and directed three films for RKO, which were filmed in French and English versions: Échec Au Roi (The Royal Bed) (an adaptation of Robert E. Sherwood's play The Queen's Husband); Le fils d'autre (The Woman Between), and Nuit d'Espagne (Transgression).[14]\n\n"
