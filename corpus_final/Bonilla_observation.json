            "text": "On August 12, 1883, the astronomer Jos√© Bonilla reported that he saw more than 300 dark, unidentified objects crossing before the Sun while observing sunspot activity at Zacatecas Observatory in Mexico.[1] He was able to take several photographs, exposing wet plates at 1/100 second. Bonilla's photos have been credited with being some of the earliest photos of unidentified flying objects. The objects were subsequently identified as high-flying geese.[2]\n\nIn 2011, researchers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico suggested that the unidentified objects may have been fragments of an estimated billion-ton comet passing within a few hundred kilometers of Earth.[3][4]\n\nSimilar comet fragments may have caused the Younger Dryas event, around 12,900 years ago.\n\n"
