The BIOLOID platform consists of components and small, modular servomechanisms called the AX-12A Dynamixels, which can be used in a daisy-chained fashion to construct robots of various configurations, such as wheeled, legged, or humanoid robots. The Robot is programmed with RoboPlus - C language based software.[1] The Bioloid system is thus comparable to the LEGO Mindstorms and VEXplorer kits.[citation needed]\n\n"
