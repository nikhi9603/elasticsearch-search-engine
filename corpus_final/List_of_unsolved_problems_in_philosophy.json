            "text": "A counterfactual statement is a conditional statement with a false antecedent. For example, the statement \"If Joseph Swan had not invented the modern incandescent light bulb, then someone else would have invented it anyway\" is a counterfactual, because in fact, Joseph Swan invented the modern incandescent light bulb. The most immediate task concerning counterfactuals is that of explaining their truth-conditions. As a start, one might assert that background information is assumed when stating and interpreting counterfactual conditionals and that this background information is just every true statement about the world as it is (pre-counterfactual). In the case of the Swan statement, we have certain trends in the history of technology, the utility of artificial light, the discovery of electricity, and so on. We quickly encounter an error with this initial account: among the true statements will be \"Joseph Swan did invent the modern incandescent light bulb.\" From the conjunction of this statement (call it \"S\") and the antecedent of the counterfactual (\"¬S\"), we can derive any conclusion, and we have the unwelcome result that any statement follows from any counterfactual (see the principle of explosion). Nelson Goodman takes up this and related issues in his seminal Fact, Fiction, and Forecast; and David Lewis's influential articulation of possible world theory is popularly applied in efforts to solve it.\n\n"

            "title": "Epistemology",
            "text": "Epistemological problems are concerned with the nature, scope and limitations of knowledge.\nEpistemology may also be described as the study of knowledge.\n\nPlato suggests, in his Theaetetus (210a) and Meno (97a–98b), that \"knowledge\" may be defined as justified true belief. For over two millennia, this definition of knowledge was accepted by subsequent philosophers. An item of information's justifiability, truth, and belief were seen as the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge.\n\nBut in 1963, Edmund Gettier published an article in the journal Analysis, a peer-reviewed academic journal of philosophy, entitled \"Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\" which offered instances of justified true belief that do not conform to the generally understood meaning of \"knowledge.\" Gettier's examples hinged on instances of epistemic luck: cases where a person appears to have sound evidence for a proposition, and that proposition is in fact true, but the apparent evidence is not causally related to the proposition's truth.\n\nIn response to Gettier's article, numerous philosophers[who?] have offered modified criteria for \"knowledge.\" There is no general consensus to adopt any of the modified definitions yet proposed. Finally, if infallibilism is true, that would seem to definitively solve the Gettier problem for good. Infallibilism states that knowledge requires certainty, such that, certainty is what serves to bridge the gap so that we arrive at knowledge, which means we would have an adequate definition of knowledge. However, infallibilism is rejected by the overwhelming majority of philosophers/epistemologists.[citation needed]\n\nOne possible solution to the Gettier problem is the \"no false lemmas\" theory, which suggests that knowledge requires not only justified true belief, but also the absence of false lemmas. A lemma is a proposition that is assumed to be true in order to prove another proposition. According to this theory, if a person's belief is based on false lemmas, then it cannot be considered knowledge.\n\nAnother possible solution is the \"defeasibility\" theory, which suggests that knowledge is justified true belief that is not easily defeated by new evidence. This means that knowledge must be able to withstand challenges or objections in order to be considered knowledge.\n\nOverlooking for a moment the complications posed by Gettier problems, philosophy has essentially continued to operate on the principle that knowledge is justified true belief. The obvious question that this definition entails is how one can know whether one's justification is sound. One must therefore provide a justification for the justification. That justification itself requires justification, and the questioning continues interminably.\n\nThe conclusion is that no one can truly have knowledge of anything, since it is, due to this infinite regression, impossible to satisfy the justification element. In practice, this has caused little concern to philosophers, since the demarcation between a reasonably exhaustive investigation and superfluous investigation is usually clear.\n\nOthers argue for forms of coherentist systems, e.g. Susan Haack. Recent work by Peter D. Klein[1] views knowledge as essentially defeasible. Therefore, an infinite regress is unproblematic, since any known fact may be overthrown on sufficiently in-depth investigation.\n\nThe Molyneux problem dates back to the following question posed by William Molyneux to John Locke in the 17th century: if a man born blind, and able to distinguish by touch between a cube and a globe, were made to see, could he now tell by sight which was the cube and which the globe, before he touched them? The problem raises fundamental issues in epistemology and the philosophy of mind, and was widely discussed after Locke included it in the second edition of his Essay Concerning Human Understanding.[2]\n\nA similar problem was also addressed earlier in the 12th century by Ibn Tufail (Abubacer), in his philosophical novel, Hayy ibn Yaqdhan (Philosophus Autodidactus). His version of the problem, however, dealt mainly with colors rather than shapes.[3][4]\n\nModern science may now have the tools necessary to test this problem in controlled environments. The resolution of this problem is in some sense provided by the study of human subjects who gain vision after extended congenital blindness. In one such study, subjects were unable to immediately link objects known by touch to their visual appearance, and only gradually developed the ability to do so over a period of days or months.[5][6][7] This indicates that this may no longer be an unsolved problem in philosophy.[fact or opinion? (See discussion.)]\nThere are a number of different solutions to the Molyneux problem, and different philosophers have proposed different answers to this question. One possible solution is the \"innate knowledge\" theory, which suggests that all humans are born with innate knowledge of certain concepts, such as the concept of a cube. According to this theory, a person who is born blind would be able to recognize a cube by touch because they already possess the innate knowledge of what a cube is.\n\nAnother possible solution is the \"empirical knowledge\" theory, which suggests that knowledge is acquired through experience and observation. According to this theory, a person who is born blind would not be able to recognize a cube by touch alone because they have never had the experience of seeing a cube and therefore do not have the necessary empirical knowledge to recognize it.\n\nThe Münchhausen trilemma, also called Agrippa's trilemma, purports that it is impossible to prove any certain truth even in fields such as logic and mathematics. According to this argument, the proof of any theory rests either on circular reasoning, infinite regress, or unproven axioms.\n\nTo solve the Münchhausen trilemma, some philosophers have suggested that we must abandon the traditional notion of justification and accept that some beliefs cannot be justified. This view is known as global skepticism, and it suggests that it is impossible to know anything with certainty.\n\nOther philosophers have proposed more moderate solutions to the Münchhausen trilemma. For example, some have suggested that we can avoid circular reasoning and unreliable sources by using a method of justification that is self-correcting. This means that our beliefs and knowledge are constantly being revised and updated based on new evidence and experience.\n\nOverall, the Münchhausen trilemma remains a topic of active debate and discussion among philosophers. While there is no one universally accepted solution to the problem, different theories and perspectives continue to be explored in an effort to better understand the nature of knowledge and justification.\n\nThe question hinges on whether color is a product of the mind or an inherent property of objects. While most philosophers will agree that color assignment corresponds to spectra of light frequencies, it is not at all clear whether the particular psychological phenomena of color are imposed on these visual signals by the mind, or whether such qualia are somehow naturally associated with their noumena. Another way to look at this question is to assume two people (\"Fred\" and \"George\" for the sake of convenience) see colors differently. That is, when Fred sees the sky, his mind interprets this light signal as blue. He calls the sky \"blue.\" However, when George sees the sky, his mind assigns green to that light frequency. If Fred were able to step into George's mind, he would be amazed that George saw green skies. However, George has learned to associate the word \"blue\" with what his mind sees as green, and so he calls the sky \"blue\", because for him the color green has the name \"blue.\" The question is whether blue must be blue for all people, or whether the perception of that particular color is assigned by the mind.\n\nThis extends to all areas of the physical reality, where the outside world we perceive is merely a representation of what is impressed upon the senses. The objects we see are in truth wave-emitting (or reflecting) objects which the brain shows to the conscious self in various forms and colors. Whether the colors and forms experienced perfectly match between person to person, may never be known. That people can communicate accurately shows that the order and proportionality in which experience is interpreted is generally reliable. Thus one's reality is, at least, compatible to another person's in terms of structure and ratio.\n\n"

            "text": "The problem of moral luck is that some people are born into, live within, and experience circumstances that seem to change their moral culpability when all other factors remain the same.\n\nFor instance, a case of circumstantial moral luck: a poor person is born into a poor family, and has no other way to feed himself so he steals his food. Another person, born into a very wealthy family, does very little but has ample food and does not need to steal to get it. Should the poor person be more morally blameworthy than the rich person? After all, it is not this person's fault that they were born into such circumstances, but a matter of \"luck\".\n\nA related case is resultant moral luck. For instance, two persons behave in a morally culpable way, such as driving carelessly, but end up producing unequal amounts of harm: two people drive while intoxicated, but one strikes a pedestrian and kills him, while the other does not. That one driver caused a death and the other did not is no part of the drivers' intentional actions; yet most observers ^[who?] would likely ascribe greater blame to the driver who killed (compare consequentialism and\nchoice).\n\nThe fundamental question of moral luck is how our moral responsibility is changed by factors over which we have no control.\n\nTo solve the problem of moral luck, some philosophers have suggested that we should focus on the intentions and character of the person involved, rather than the outcome of their actions. This means that we should judge a person's moral character based on their intentions and the reasons behind their actions, rather than the consequences of those actions.\n\nAnother possible solution to the problem of moral luck is to focus on the actions themselves, rather than the outcomes. This means that we should judge the morality of an action based on the action itself, rather than the consequences that it produces.\n\nAre moral facts possible, what do they consist in, and how do we come to know them? Rightness and wrongness seem to be strange kinds of entities, and different from the usual properties of things in the world, such as wetness, redness, or solidity. Richmond Campbell has outlined these kinds of issues in his encyclopedia article \"Moral Epistemology\".[8]\n\nIn particular, he considers three alternative explanations of moral facts as: theological, (supernatural, the commands of God); non-natural (based on intuitions); or simply natural properties (such as leading to pleasure or to happiness). There are cogent arguments against each of these alternative accounts, he claims, and there has not been any fourth alternative proposed. So the existence of moral knowledge and moral facts remains dubious and in need of further investigation. But moral knowledge supposedly already plays an important part in our everyday thinking, in our legal systems  and criminal investigations.\n\nOne possible solution to the problem of moral knowledge is the moral intuitionist approach, which suggests that our moral knowledge is based on innate moral intuitions or instincts. According to this view, we have a natural sense of what is right or wrong, and we use this sense to guide our moral decisions and actions.\n\nAnother possible solution is the moral reasoning approach, which suggests that our moral knowledge is based on our ability to reason about moral issues and principles. According to this view, we use our cognitive abilities to think about moral issues, and we use our moral reasoning skills to come to moral conclusions.\n\n"

            "text": "What are numbers, sets, groups, points, etc.? Are they real objects or are they simply relationships that necessarily exist in all structures? Although many disparate views exist regarding what a mathematical object is, the discussion may be roughly partitioned into two opposing schools of thought: platonism, which asserts that mathematical objects are real, and formalism, which asserts that mathematical objects are merely formal constructions. This dispute may be better understood when considering specific examples, such as the \"continuum hypothesis\". The continuum hypothesis has been proven independent of the ZF axioms of set theory, so within that system, the proposition can neither be proven true nor proven false. A formalist would therefore say that the continuum hypothesis is neither true nor false, unless you further refine the context of the question. A platonist, however, would assert that there either does or does not exist a transfinite set with a cardinality less than the continuum but greater than any countable set.[citation needed] So, regardless of whether it has been proven unprovable, the platonist would argue that an answer nonetheless does exist.\n\n"

            "title": "Metaphysics",
            "text": "The question about why is there anything at all instead of nothing has been raised or commented on by philosophers including Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz,[9] Martin Heidegger − who called it the fundamental question of metaphysics[10][11] − and Ludwig Wittgenstein.[12] The question is general, rather than concerning the existence of anything specific such as the universe/s, the Big Bang, mathematical laws, physical laws, time, consciousness or God.\n\nOne possible answer to this question is that the universe simply exists, and there is no need to explain why it exists. This is known as the \"principle of sufficient reason,\" which holds that everything that exists has a cause or explanation, but the existence of the universe itself does not require a cause or explanation.\n\nAnother possible answer is that the universe exists because of the laws of physics and the fundamental constants of nature. According to this view, the universe came into existence as a result of the laws of physics and the initial conditions of the universe, and it continues to exist and evolve according to these laws.\n\nYet another possible answer is that the universe exists because of the will or decision of a conscious, intelligent being, such as God. This is a common view in many religious traditions, which hold that God created the universe and continues to sustain and govern it according to his will.\n\nUltimately, the question of why there is anything at all is a deep and complex question that may have many different answers, depending on one's perspective and beliefs.\n\nThe problem of universals refers to the question of whether properties exist, and if so, what they are.[13] Properties are qualities or relations or names that two or more entities have in common.[14] The various kinds of properties, such as qualities and relations, are referred to as universals. For instance, one can imagine three cup holders on a table that have in common the quality of being circular or exemplifying circularity,[15][16] or bear the same name, \"circular cup\" or two daughters that have in common being the female offsprings of Frank. There are many such properties, such as being human, red, male or female, liquid, big or small, taller than, father of, etc.[17] While philosophers agree that human beings talk and think about properties, they disagree on whether these universals exist in reality or merely in thought, speech and sight.\n\nThere are many different ways in which philosophers and logicians have attempted to solve the problem of universals. One approach is to reject the existence of universals, and to argue that general concepts are merely mental constructs or ideas that we use to organize and understand the world, but that do not correspond to any objective reality or existence. This approach is often associated with nominalism, which holds that universals are mere words or labels that we use to refer to groups of things, but that have no real existence or essence.\n\nAnother approach is to accept the existence of universals, but to argue that they are not separate or distinct from the individual things that instantiate them. According to this view, universals are simply the ways in which individual things resemble or resemble each other, and they are not separate entities or substances that exist independently of the individual things. This approach is often associated with conceptualism, which holds that universals are mental constructs or ideas that we use to understand the world, but that do not have any independent existence or reality.\n\nA third approach is to accept the existence of universals, and to argue that they are separate and distinct from the individual things that instantiate them. According to this view, universals are real and objective entities or substances that exist independently of the individual things, and that are the source or cause of the similarity or resemblance between them. This approach is often associated with realism, which holds that universals are objective and mind-independent entities that exist in the world, and that are the basis of our general concepts and ideas.\n\nRelated to the problem of universals, the principle of individuation is what individuates universals.\n\nThere are many different ways in which philosophers and logicians have attempted to solve the problem of individuation, or to provide a precise and comprehensive account of the principle. One approach is to define the principle in terms of the physical characteristics or properties of things, such as their shape, size, or location. This approach is often associated with the philosophy of realism, which holds that individual things have objective and mind-independent properties that can be used to distinguish them from other things.\n\nAnother approach is to define the principle in terms of the mental or subjective experiences of things, such as the sensations, perceptions, or thoughts that we have of them. This approach is often associated with the philosophy of idealism, which holds that individual things are constructs or creations of the mind, and that their identity or essence depends on the way in which we experience or understand them.\n\nA third approach is to define the principle in terms of the social or cultural context in which things exist, such as the customs, norms, or conventions that are used to distinguish one thing from another. This approach is often associated with the philosophy of social constructivism, which holds that individual things are defined and distinguished by the social and cultural frameworks in which they are embedded.\n\nOtherwise known as the \"paradox of the heap\", the question regards how one defines a \"thing.\" Is a bale of hay still a bale of hay if you remove one straw? If so, is it still a bale of hay if you remove another straw? If you continue this way, you will eventually deplete the entire bale of hay, and the question is: at what point is it no longer a bale of hay? While this may initially seem like a superficial problem, it penetrates to fundamental issues regarding how we define objects. This is similar to Theseus' paradox and the continuum fallacy.\n\nThere are many different ways in which philosophers and logicians have attempted to solve the Sorites paradox. One approach is to reject the premise of the paradox, and to argue that the concept of a heap is not well-defined, or that it is not subject to the same rules of logic as other concepts.\n\nAnother approach is to accept the premise of the paradox, but to argue that it does not have any practical or philosophical significance. According to this view, the paradox is simply a logical puzzle that is interesting to think about, but that does not have any real-world implications or consequences.\n\nA third approach is to try to provide a precise definition of a heap that can avoid the paradox, such as by defining a heap as a collection of at least 100 grains of sand, or by defining a heap in terms of its shape, size, or other properties. This approach is often associated with the philosophy of vagueness, which seeks to explain how concepts that are inherently vague or imprecise can still be used and understood.\n\nAlso known as the ship of Theseus, this is a classical paradox on the first branch of metaphysics, ontology (philosophy of existence and identity). The paradox runs thus: There used to be the great ship of Theseus which was made out of, say, 100 parts. Each part has a single corresponding replacement part in the ship's storeroom. The ship then sets out on a voyage. The ship sails through monster-infested waters, and every day, a single piece is damaged and has to be replaced. On the hundredth day, the ship sails back to port, the voyage completed. Through the course of this journey, everything on the ship has been replaced. So, is the ship sailing back home the ship of Theseus or not?\n\nIf yes, consider this: the broken original parts are repaired and re-assembled. Is this the ship of Theseus or not? If not, let us name the ship that sails into port \"The Argo\". At what point (during the journey) did the crew of the Theseus become the crew of the Argo? And what ship is sailing on the fiftieth day? If both the ships trade a single piece, are they still the same ships?\n\nThis paradox is a minor variation of the Sorites Paradox above, and has many variations itself. Both sides of the paradox have convincing arguments and counter-arguments, though no one is close to proving it completely.\n\nOne possible solution to the Theseus paradox is the \"functional\" approach, which suggests that an object remains the same if it continues to function in the same way, regardless of the changes to its parts. According to this view, the ship of Theseus would remain the same object as long as it continued to sail and function as a ship, even if all of its parts were replaced.\n\nAnother possible solution is the \"identity\" approach, which suggests that an object remains the same if it retains its identity over time. According to this view, the ship of Theseus would remain the same object as long as it retained its unique identity, regardless of the changes to its parts.\n\nPeople have a rather clear idea of what if-then means. In formal logic however, material implication defines if-then, which is not consistent with the common understanding of conditionals. In formal logic, the statement \"If today is Saturday, then 1+1=2\" is true. However, '1+1=2' is true regardless of the content of the antecedent; a causal or meaningful relation is not required. The statement as a whole must be true, because 1+1=2 cannot be false. (If it could, then on a given Saturday, so could the statement). Formal logic has shown itself extremely useful in formalizing argumentation, philosophical reasoning, and mathematics. The discrepancy between material implication and the general conception of conditionals however is a topic of intense investigation: whether it is an inadequacy in formal logic, an ambiguity of ordinary language, or as championed by H. P. Grice, that no discrepancy exists.\n\nIt can be interpreted as logical connective that is used to form statements that are called material implications. It is often symbolized by the symbol \"→\" and is used to express the idea that if one statement is true, then the other statement must also be true. For example, the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" can be represented using the material conditional as \"Raining → Wet ground.\" The truth of this statement depends on whether the antecedent (the part before the arrow) is true or false. If the antecedent is true, then the statement is considered true regardless of whether the consequent (the part after the arrow) is true or false. However, if the antecedent is false, then the statement is considered true only if the consequent is also false.\n\n"

            "title": "Philosophy of science",
            "text": "The mind–body problem is the problem of determining the relationship between the human body and the human mind. Philosophical positions on this question are generally predicated on either a reduction of one to the other, or a belief in the discrete coexistence of both. This problem is usually exemplified by Descartes, who championed a dualistic picture. The problem therein is to establish how the mind and body communicate in a dualistic framework. Neurobiology and emergence have further complicated the problem by allowing the material functions of the mind to be a representation of some further aspect emerging from the mechanistic properties of the brain. The brain essentially stops generating conscious thought during deep sleep; the ability to restore such a pattern remains a mystery to science and is a subject of current research (see also neurophilosophy).\n\nThere are many different ways in which philosophers and scientists have attempted to solve the mind-body problem. One approach is to deny the existence of the mind or the body, such as by adopting a materialistic view that only the physical world exists, or a idealistic view that only the mental world exists.\n\nAnother approach is to try to reconcile the mind and body by positing some sort of interaction or influence between them. For example, some philosophers and scientists have proposed that the mind and body are separate but interacting entities, or that the mind is a product or manifestation of the brain and the body.\n\nA third approach is to reject the idea that the mind-body problem can be solved at all, and instead to focus on understanding the phenomena of mind and body in terms of the ways in which they are observed and experienced. This approach is often associated with a philosophy called phenomenology, which emphasizes the subjective experience of the world.\n\nUltimately, the mind-body problem is a complex and controversial issue that continues to be a subject of debate and discussion in philosophy and science. There is no definitive solution to the problem, and different people may have different perspectives on how to approach it.\n\nThis problem actually defines a field; however, its pursuits are specific and easily stated. Firstly, what are the criteria for intelligence? What are the necessary components for defining consciousness? Secondly, how can an outside observer test for these criteria? The \"Turing Test\" is often cited as a prototypical test of intelligence, although it is almost universally regarded as insufficient. It involves a conversation between a sentient being and a machine, and if the being can't tell he is talking to a machine, it is considered intelligent. A well trained machine, however, could theoretically \"parrot\" its way through the test. This raises the corollary question of whether it is possible to artificially create consciousness (usually in the context of computers or machines), and of how to tell a well-trained mimic from a sentient entity.\n\nImportant thought in this area includes most notably: John Searle's Chinese Room, Hubert Dreyfus' non-cognitivist critique, as well as Hilary Putnam's work on Functionalism.\n\nA related field is the ethics of artificial intelligence, which addresses such problems as the existence of moral personhood of AIs, the possibility of moral obligations to AIs (for instance, the right of a possibly sentient computer system to not be turned off), and the question of making AIs that behave ethically towards humans and others.\n\nThere are many different ways in which the fields of cognition and AI can be related or intersect. For example, the study of cognition can provide valuable insights into the nature of intelligence and the mental processes that underlie it, which can be used to inform the design and development of AI systems. Similarly, the study of AI can provide valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence, and can help to identify areas where further research and development is needed in order to improve the performance and functionality of AI systems.\n\nAnother way in which cognition and AI can be related is through the use of AI techniques and technologies to study and understand cognitive processes and abilities. For example, researchers in the field of cognitive computing use AI techniques, such as machine learning and natural language processing, to analyze and interpret large amounts of data in order to gain a better understanding of the cognitive mechanisms that underlie perception, memory, and decision-making.\n\nThe hard problem of consciousness is the question of what consciousness is and why we have consciousness as opposed to being philosophical zombies. The adjective \"hard\" is to contrast with the \"easy\" consciousness problems, which seek to explain the mechanisms of consciousness (\"why\" versus \"how\", or final cause versus efficient cause). The hard problem of consciousness is questioning whether all beings undergo an experience of consciousness rather than questioning the neurological makeup of beings.\n\nThere are many different ways in which philosophers and scientists have attempted to solve the hard problem of consciousness. One approach is to reject the idea that consciousness is a problem that can be solved, and to argue that it is a subjective and ineffable experience that cannot be explained or understood in scientific or objective terms. This approach is often associated with the philosophy of subjective idealism, which holds that consciousness is the only reality, and that the physical world is an illusion or projection of the mind.\n\nAnother approach is to try to explain consciousness in terms of the physical activity of the brain, such as by positing a neurobiological basis for consciousness or by proposing that consciousness is a product or emergent property of the brain. This approach is often associated with the philosophy of materialism, which holds that consciousness is a byproduct or epiphenomenon of the activity of the brain, and that it has no independent existence or reality.\n\nA third approach is to try to reconcile the physical and the mental by positing some sort of interaction or influence between them, such as by proposing that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of the universe that is not reducible to the activity of the brain, or that it is a separate and independent entity that exists alongside the physical world. This approach is often associated with the philosophy of dualism, which holds that the mind and the body are separate but interacting entities, and that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of the universe that cannot be explained in terms of physical processes alone.\n\nIntuitively, it seems to be the case that we know certain things with absolute, complete, utter, unshakable certainty. For example, if you travel to the Arctic and touch an iceberg, you know that it would feel cold. These things that we know from experience are known through induction. The problem of induction in short; (1) any inductive statement (like the sun will rise tomorrow) can only be deductively shown if one assumes that nature is uniform. (2) the only way to show that nature is uniform is by using induction. Thus induction cannot be justified deductively.\n\nThere are many different ways in which philosophers and logicians have attempted to solve the problem of induction. One approach is to reject the idea that induction is a problem at all, and to argue that it is a natural and intuitive way of reasoning that is essential to human cognition and behavior. According to this view, induction is simply a form of inference that we use to make sense of the world, and it is not subject to the same standards of justification or proof as other forms of reasoning.\n\nAnother approach is to try to provide a logical or mathematical justification for induction, such as by showing that it follows from certain axioms or principles of probability or logic. This approach is often associated with the philosophy of logical positivism, which holds that knowledge and truth can be derived from logical or mathematical analysis, and that induction is a form of reasoning that can be validated by these methods.\n\nA third approach is to reject the idea that induction can be justified or validated in any absolute or certain way, and to argue that it is inherently uncertain or unreliable. According to this view, induction is a form of reasoning that is based on incomplete or uncertain information, and it is subject to error or bias. This approach is often associated with skepticism, which holds that our beliefs and knowledge are always provisional and subject to revision in the light of new evidence or experience.\n\n'The problem of demarcation' is an expression introduced by Karl Popper to refer to 'the problem of finding a criterion which would enable us to distinguish between the empirical sciences on the one hand, and mathematics and logic as well as \"metaphysical\" systems on the other'. Popper attributes this problem to Kant. Although Popper mentions mathematics and logic, other writers focus on distinguishing science from metaphysics.\n\nThere have been many different attempts to solve the demarcation problem, and no consensus has been reached on the best way to approach it. One approach is to define science in terms of its methods, such as the use of empirical observation, experimentation, and falsifiability. This approach is often associated with the philosophy of positivism, which holds that only knowledge that is based on empirical observations can be considered scientific.\n\nAnother approach is to define science in terms of its goals or objectives, such as the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the natural world. This approach is often associated with the philosophy of naturalism, which holds that science is the best way to understand the natural world, and that all other forms of knowledge are subordinate to science.\n\nA third approach is to define science in terms of its assumptions or beliefs, such as the belief in the existence of objective reality and the law-like regularity of nature. This approach is often associated with the philosophy of realism, which holds that science is based on a commitment to certain metaphysical assumptions about the nature of reality.\n\nDoes a world independent of human beliefs and representations exist? Is such a world empirically accessible, or would such a world be forever beyond the bounds of human sense and hence unknowable? Can human activity and agency change the objective structure of the world? These questions continue to receive much attention in the philosophy of science. A clear \"yes\" to the first question is a hallmark of the scientific realism perspective. Philosophers such as Bas van Fraassen have important and interesting answers to the second question. In addition to the realism vs. empiricism axis of debate, there is a realism vs. social constructivism axis which heats many academic passions. With respect to the third question, Paul Boghossian's Fear of Knowledge: Against Relativism and Constructivism[18] is a powerful critique of social constructivism, for instance. Ian Hacking's The Social Construction of What?[19] constitutes a more moderate critique of constructivism, which usefully disambiguates confusing polysemy of the term \"constructivism.\"\n\n"

            "text": "Philosophy of religion encompasses attempts within metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and other major philosophical fields to philosophically analyze concepts within religion, the nature of religion itself, and alternatives to religion.\n\nDoes God exist? A rich variety of arguments including forms of the contingency argument, ontological argument, and moral argument have been proposed by philosophers like Aristotle, Descartes, Leibniz, Gödel, and Aquinas for the existence of God throughout history. Arguments for God usually refer to some form of metaphysically or logically necessary maximally great being distinct from individual deities, although philosophers have also proposed different concepts of God. Wittgenstein and Kant, on the other hand, defended religious belief while doubting that rational arguments could prove God's existence. Philosophers have also considered objections to the existence of God like the problem of evil and divine hiddenness.\n\nWhat is God like? Philosophers like John Stuart Mill and Aquinas addressed the question of what the nature of God is if God exists. Some of the key disagreements concern the doctrine of impassibility and the coherency of a maximally great being or properties like omnipotence.\n\nCan religious belief be justified? When? According to the Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, religious epistemology \"investigates the epistemic status of propositional attitudes about religious claims.\" Philosophers like Kant, Kierkegaard, William James, and Alvin Plantinga have debated stances towards the epistemic status of religious belief like reformed epistemology, fideism, and evidentialism.\n\nWhat is the relationship between science and religion? Philosophers like Paul Feyerabend, A. C. Grayling, and Alvin Plantinga have debated whether they are in conflict, incompatible, incommensurable, or independent.\n\n"

The opposite has also been claimed, for example by Karl Popper, who held that such problems do exist, that they are solvable, and that he had actually found definite solutions to some of them.\n\nDavid Chalmers divides inquiry into philosophical progress in metaphilosophy into three questions.\n\n"
