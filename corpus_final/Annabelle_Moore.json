            "text": "Annabelle Whitford was born in Chicago. She made her debut at age 15 dancing at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.[3] She later moved to New York City, where she performed in several films for the Edison Studios[4] and appeared on Broadway.\n\nAnnabelle was quite popular in her youth. The sale of her films was further boosted in December 1896[5] when it was revealed that she had been approached to appear naked at a private dinner party at Sherry's Restaurant.[6][7] It was said she introduced eroticism in film.[8]\n\nShe married Edward James Buchan in 1910. He died in 1958.\n\nAlthough she was very popular before her marriage,[9] Annabelle died penniless in Chicago in 1961.[10][11]\n\n"
