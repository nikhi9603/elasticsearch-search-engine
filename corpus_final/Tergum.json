            "text": "A tergum (Latin for \"the back\"; plural terga, associated adjective tergal) is the dorsal ('upper') portion of an arthropod segment other than the head. The anterior edge is called the 'base' and posterior edge is called the 'apex' or 'margin'. A given tergum may be divided into hardened plates or sclerites commonly referred to as tergites.[1]\n\nIn a thoracic segment, for example, the tergum may be divided into an anterior notum and a posterior scutellum. Lateral extensions of a tergite are known as paranota (Greek for \"alongside the back\") or carinae (Latin for \"keel\"), exemplified by the flat-backed millipedes of the order Polydesmida.\n\nKinorhynchs have tergal and sternal plates too, though seemingly not homologous with those of arthropods.[2]\n\nTergo-tergal is a stridulatory mechanism in which fine spines of the abdominal tergites are rubbed together to produce sound.[3] This process is known as abdominal telescoping.[3]\n\n"
