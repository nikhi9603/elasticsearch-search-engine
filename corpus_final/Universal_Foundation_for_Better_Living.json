Named the Universal Foundation for Better Living, the foundation had 22,000 members in the late 1980s, with a 32-acre facility in the Chicago-area.[3] The foundation adheres closely to the principles taught by Charles and Myrtle Fillmore.[4]\n\nToday the denomination has more than 30 churches across the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean, with a majority of African American members. Colemon appointed Mary A. Tumpkin as President of the foundation in 1995, where she served until she died in November 2013.[5] In 2015,  Sheila R. McKeithen became the foundation's third President.\n\n"
