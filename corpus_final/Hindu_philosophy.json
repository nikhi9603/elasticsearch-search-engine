            "text": "\n\nHindu philosophy encompasses the philosophies, world views and teachings[1] of Hinduism that emerged in Ancient India which include six systems (shad-darśana) – Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta.[2] In Indian tradition, the word used for philosophy is Darshana (Viewpoint or perspective), from the Sanskrit root drish ('to see, to experience').[3]\n\nThese are also called the Astika (theistic) philosophical traditions and are those that accept the Vedas as an authoritative, important source of knowledge.[4][note 1][note 2] Ancient and medieval India was also the source of philosophies that share philosophical concepts but rejected the Vedas, and these have been called nāstika (heterodox or non-orthodox) Indian philosophies.[2][4] Nāstika Indian philosophies include Buddhism, Jainism, Chārvāka, Ājīvika, and others.[7]\n\nWestern scholars have debated the relationship and differences within āstika philosophies and with nāstika philosophies, starting with the writings of Indologists and Orientalists of the 18th and 19th centuries, which were themselves derived from limited availability of Indian literature and medieval doxographies.[2] The various sibling traditions included in Hindu philosophies are diverse, and they are united by shared history and concepts, same textual resources, similar ontological and soteriological focus, and cosmology.[8][9] While Buddhism and Jainism are considered distinct philosophies and religions, some heterodox (nāstika) traditions such as Cārvāka are often considered as distinct schools within Hindu philosophy because the word Hindu is also an exonym and historically, the term has also been used as a geographical and cultural identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent.[10][11][12][13]\n\nHindu philosophy also includes several sub-schools of theistic philosophies that integrate ideas from two or more of the six orthodox philosophies, such as the realism of the Nyāya, the naturalism of the Vaiśeṣika, the dualism of the Sāṅkhya, the non-dualism and knowledge of Self as essential to liberation of Advaita, the self-discipline of Yoga and the asceticism and elements of theistic ideas.[14][15][16] Examples of such schools include Pāśupata Śaiva, Śaiva siddhānta, Pratyabhijña, Raseśvara and Vaiṣṇava.[14][15] Some sub-schools share Tantric ideas with those found in some Buddhist traditions.[17] The ideas of these sub-schools are found in the Puranas and Āgamas.[18][19][20]\n\nEach school of Hindu philosophy has extensive epistemological literature called Pramana,[21][22] as well as theories on metaphysics, axiology, and other topics.[23]\n\n"

            "text": "In the history of India, the six orthodox schools had emerged before the start of the Common Era, and some schools emerged possibly even before the Buddha.[24] Some scholars have questioned whether the orthodox and heterodox schools classification is sufficient or accurate, given the diversity and evolution of views within each major school of Indian philosophy, with some sub-schools combining heterodox and orthodox views.[25]\n\nSince ancient times, Indian philosophy has been categorized into āstika and nāstika schools of thought.[26] The orthodox schools of Indian philosophy have been called ṣaḍdarśana ('six systems'). This schema was created between the 12th and 16th centuries by Vedantins.[27]: 2–3  It was then adopted by the early Western Indologists, and pervades modern understandings of Indian philosophy.[27]: 4–5 \n\nThere are six āstika (orthodox) schools of thought.[note 3] Each is called a darśana, and each darśana accepts the Vedas as authority. Each āstika darśana also accepts the premise that Atman (eternal Self) exists.[4][28] The āstika schools of philosophy are:\n\nSchools that do not accept the authority of the Vedas are nāstika philosophies, of which four nāstika (heterodox) schools are prominent:[7]\n\nBesides the major orthodox and non-orthodox schools, there have existed syncretic sub-schools that have combined ideas and introduced new ones of their own. The medieval scholar Madhavacharya, identified by some as Vidyaranya, in his book 'Sarva-Darsana-Sangraha', includes the following, along with Buddhism[35] and Jainism,[36] as sub-schools of Hindu philosophy:\n\nThe above sub-schools introduced their own ideas while adopting concepts from orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy such as realism of the Nyāya, naturalism of Vaiśeṣika, monism and knowledge of Self (Atman) as essential to liberation of Advaita, self-discipline of Yoga, asceticism and elements of theistic ideas.[14] Some sub-schools share Tantric ideas with those found in some Buddhist traditions.[17]\n\n"

            "text": "Epistemology is called pramana.[50] It has been a key, much debated field of study in Hinduism since ancient times. Pramāṇa is a Hindu theory of knowledge and discusses the valid means by which human beings can gain accurate knowledge.[50] The focus of pramāṇa is how correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows, how one does not, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.[21]\n\nAncient and medieval Hindu texts identify six pramāṇas as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths: \n\nEach of these are further categorized in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error, by the different schools. The schools vary on how many of these six are valid paths of knowledge.[22] For example, the Cārvāka nāstika philosophy holds that only one (perception) is an epistemically reliable means of knowledge,[52] the Samkhya school holds that three are (perception, inference and testimony),[52] while the Mīmāṃsā and Advaita schools hold that all six are epistemically useful and reliable means to knowledge.[52][53]\n\n"

            "text": "Samkhya is the oldest of the orthodox philosophical systems in Hinduism,[54] with origins in the 1st millennium BCE.[55] It is a rationalist school of Indian philosophy,[46] and had a strong influence on other schools of Indian philosophies.[56] Sāmkhya is an enumerationist philosophy whose epistemology accepted three of six pramāṇas as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge. These were pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference) and sabda (Āptavacana, word/testimony of reliable sources).[57][52]\n\nSamkhya school espouses dualism between witness-consciousness and 'nature' (mind, perception, matter).[58] It regards the universe as consisting of two realities: Puruṣa (witness-consciousness) and prakriti ('nature'). Jiva (a living being) is that state in which puruṣa is bonded to prakriti in some form.[59] This fusion, state the Samkhya scholars, led to the emergence of buddhi (awareness, intellect) and ahankara (individualized ego consciousness, \"I-maker\"). The universe is described by this school as one created by Purusa-Prakriti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind.[59]\n\nSamkhya philosophy includes a theory of gunas (qualities, innate tendencies, psyche).[60] Guna, it states, are of three types: Sattva being good, compassionate, illuminating, positive, and constructive; Rajas guna is one of activity, chaotic, passion, impulsive, potentially good or bad; and Tamas being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destructive, lethargic, negative. Everything, all life forms and human beings, state Samkhya scholars, have these three gunas, but in different proportions.[61] The interplay of these gunas defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life.[62][63] Samkhya theorises a pluralism of Selfs (Jeevatmas) who possess consciousness.[64] Samkhya has historically been theistic or non-theistic, and there has been debate about its specific view on God.[65][66][67][68]\n\nThe Samkhya karika, one of the key texts of this school of Hindu philosophy, opens by stating its goal to be \"three[69] kinds of human suffering\" and means to prevent them.[70] The text then presents a distillation of its theories on epistemology, metaphysics, axiology and soteriology. For example, it states,\n\nThe soteriology in Samkhya aims at the realization of Puruṣa as distinct from Prakriti; this knowledge of the Self is held to end transmigration and lead to absolute freedom (kaivalya).[72]\n\n"

            "text": "In Indian philosophy, Yoga is, among other things, the name of one of the six āstika philosophical schools.[73]  The Yoga philosophical system aligns closely with the dualist premises of the Samkhya school.[74][75] The Yoga school accepts Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is considered theistic because it accepts the concept of personal god (Ishvara), unlike Samkhya.[76][77][78] The epistemology of the Yoga school, like the Sāmkhya school, relies on three of six prāmaṇas as the means of gaining reliable knowledge:[52] pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference) and śabda (āptavacana, word/testimony of reliable sources).[53][52]\n\nThe universe is conceptualized as a duality in Yoga school: puruṣa (witness-consciousness) and prakṛti (mind, perception, matter); however, the Yoga school discusses this concept more generically as \"seer, experiencer\" and \"seen, experienced\" than the Samkhya school.[79]\n\nA key text of the Yoga school is the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Patanjali may have been, as Max Müller explains, \"the author or representative of the Yoga-philosophy without being necessarily the author of the Sutras.\"[80] Hindu philosophy recognizes many types of Yoga, such as rāja yoga, jñāna yoga,[81] karma yoga, bhakti yoga, tantra yoga, mantra yoga, laya yoga, and hatha yoga.[82]\n\nThe Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that jñāna (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha. It suggests that systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha.[74] Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta, with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of monistic personalism.[83][84][85] Like Advaita Vedanta, the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy holds that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable, and that this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman (Self) and Brahman.[86][87]\n\n"

Each of these four are of two types:[88] atomic (paramāṇu) and composite. An atom is, according to Vaiśeṣika scholars, that which is indestructible (anitya), indivisible, and has a special kind of dimension, called \"small\" (aṇu). A composite, in this philosophy, is defined to be anything which is divisible into atoms. Whatever human beings perceive is composite, while atoms are invisible.[88] The Vaiśeṣikas stated that size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements, their guṇa (quality), karma (activity), sāmānya (commonness), viśeṣa (particularity) and amavāya (inherence, inseparable connectedness of everything).[89][95]\n\n"

This premise led Nyāya to concern itself with epistemology, that is, the reliable means to gain correct knowledge and to remove wrong notions.

            "text": "The Mīmāṃsā school emphasized hermeneutics and exegesis.[105][106] It is a form of philosophical realism.[107] Key texts of the Mīmāṃsā school are the Purva Mimamsa Sutras of Jaimini.[108][109] The classical Mīmāṃsā school is sometimes referred to as pūrvamīmāṃsā or Karmamīmāṃsā in reference to the first part of the Vedas.[108]\n\nThe Mīmāṃsā school has several sub-schools defined by epistemology. The Prābhākara subschool of Mīmāṃsā accepted five means to gaining knowledge as epistimetically reliable: pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference), upamāṇa (comparison and analogy), arthāpatti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), and śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).[101][51] The Kumārila Bhaṭṭa sub-school of Mīmāṃsā added a sixth way of knowing to its canon of reliable epistemology: anupalabdi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof).[52]\n\nThe metaphysics of the Mīmāṃsā school consists of both atheistic and theistic doctrines, and the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of God. Rather, it held that the Self (Atma) is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active spiritual essence, then focussed on the epistemology and metaphysics of dharma.[108][110][111] To them, dharma meant rituals and duties, not devas (gods), because devas existed only in name.[108] The Mīmāṃsākas held that the Vedas are \"eternal authorless infallible\", that Vedic vidhi (injunctions) and mantras in rituals are prescriptive karya (actions), and that the rituals are of primary importance and merit. They considered the Upanishads and other texts related to self-knowledge and spirituality to be of secondary importance, a philosophical view that the Vedanta school disagreed with.[105][108]\n\nMīmāṃsā gave rise to the study of philology and the philosophy of language.[112] While their deep analysis of language and linguistics influenced other schools,[113] their views were not shared by others. Mīmāṃsākas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly prescribe the proper, correct and right. In contrast, Vedantins extended the scope and value of language as a tool to also describe, develop and derive.[108] Mīmāṃsākas considered orderly, law-driven, procedural life as the central purpose and noblest necessity of dharma and society, and divine (theistic) sustenance means to that end. The Mimamsa school was influential and foundational to the Vedanta school, with the difference that Mīmāṃsā developed and emphasized karmakāṇḍa (the portion of the śruti which relates to ceremonial acts and sacrificial rites, the early parts of the Vedas), while the Vedanta school developed and emphasized jñānakāṇḍa (the portion of the Vedas which relates to knowledge of monism, the latter parts of the Vedas).[105]\n\n"

            "text": "The Vedanta school built upon the teachings of the Upanishads and Brahma Sutras from the first millennium BCE[90][114] and is the most developed[citation needed] and best-known of the Hindu schools. The epistemology of the Vedantins included, depending on the sub-school, five or six methods as proper and reliable means of gaining any form of knowledge:[94] pratyakṣa (perception), anumāṇa (inference), upamāṇa (comparison and analogy), arthāpatti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), anupalabdi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and śabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).[53][52][51] All of these have been further categorized by each sub-school of Vedanta in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error.[94]\n\nThe emergence of the Vedanta school represented a period in which a more knowledge-centered understanding began to emerge, focusing on jnana (knowledge) driven aspects of the Vedic religion and the Upanishads. These included metaphysical concepts such as ātman and Brahman, and an emphasis on meditation, self-discipline, self-knowledge and abstract spirituality, rather than ritualism. The Upanishads were variously interpreted by ancient- and medieval-era Vedanta scholars. Consequently, the Vedanta separated into many sub-schools, ranging from theistic dualism to non-theistic monism, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own series of sub-commentaries.[115][116]\n\nAdvaita literally means \"not two, sole, unity\". It is a sub-school of Vedanta, and asserts spiritual and universal non-dualism.[117][118] Its metaphysics is a form of absolute monism, that is all ultimate reality is interconnected oneness.[119][120] This is the oldest and most widely acknowledged Vedantic school. The foundational texts of this school are the Brahma Sutras and the early Upanishads from the 1st millennium BCE.[119] Its first great consolidator was the 8th century scholar Adi Shankara, who continued the line of thought of the Upanishadic teachers, and that of his teacher's teacher Gaudapada. He wrote extensive commentaries on the major Vedantic scriptures and is celebrated as one of the major Hindu philosophers from whose doctrines the main currents of modern Indian thought are derived.[121]\n\nAccording to this school of Vedanta, all reality is Brahman, and there exists nothing whatsoever which is not Brahman.[122] Its metaphysics includes the concept of māyā and ātman. Māyā connotes \"that which exists, but is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal\".[123] The empirical reality is considered as always changing and therefore \"transitory, incomplete, misleading and not what it appears to be\".[124][125][126] The concept of ātman is of one Atman, with the light of Atman reflected within each person as jivatman. Advaita Vedantins assert that ātman is same as Brahman, and this Brahman is reflected within each human being and all life, all living beings are spiritually interconnected, and there is oneness in all of existence.[127][128] They hold that dualities and misunderstanding of māyā as the spiritual reality that matters is caused by ignorance, and are the cause of sorrow, suffering. Jīvanmukti (liberation during life) can be achieved through Self-knowledge, the understanding that ātman within is same as ātman in another person and all of Brahman – the eternal, unchanging, entirety of cosmic principles and true reality.[129][128]\n\nRamanuja (c. 1037–1137) was the foremost proponent of the philosophy of Viśiṣṭādvaita or qualified non-dualism. Viśiṣṭādvaita advocated the concept of a Supreme Being with essential qualities or attributes. Viśiṣṭādvaitins argued against the Advaitin conception of Brahman as an impersonal empty oneness. They saw Brahman as an eternal oneness, but also as the source of all creation, which was omnipresent and actively involved in existence. To them the sense of subject-object perception was illusory and a sign of ignorance. However, the individual's sense of self was not a complete illusion since it was derived from the universal beingness that is Brahman.[130] Ramanuja saw Vishnu as a personification of Brahman.\n\nDvaita refers to a theistic sub-school in Vedanta tradition of Hindu philosophy.[131][132] Also called Tattvavāda and Bimbapratibimbavāda, the Dvaita sub-school was founded by the 13th-century scholar Madhvacharya.[131] The Dvaita Vedanta school believes that God (Vishnu, Paramatman) and the individual Selfs (Atman) (jīvātman) exist as independent realities, and these are distinct.[133][134]\n\nDvaita Vedanta is a dualistic interpretation of the Vedas; it espouses dualism by theorizing the existence of two separate realities.[131] The first and the only independent reality, states the Dvaita school, is that of Vishnu or Brahman.[131] Vishnu is the Paramatman, in a manner similar to monotheistic God in other major religions.[135] The distinguishing factor of Dvaita philosophy, as opposed to monistic Advaita Vedanta, is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.[136] Like Vishishtadvaita Vedanta subschool, Dvaita philosophy also embraced Vaishnavism, with the metaphysical concept of Brahman in the Vedas identified with Vishnu and the one and only Supreme Being.[137][138] However, unlike Vishishtadvaita which envisions ultimate qualified nondualism, the dualism of Dvaita was permanent.[134][133]\n\nSalvation, in Dvaita, is achievable only through the grace of God Vishnu.[131][139][140]\n\nDvaitādvaita was proposed by Nimbarka, a 13th-century Vaishnava philosopher from the Andhra region. According to this philosophy there are three categories of existence: Brahman, Self, and matter. Self and matter are different from Brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from Brahman. Brahman exists independently, while Self and matter are dependent. Thus Self and matter have an existence that is separate yet dependent. Further, Brahman is a controller, the Self is the enjoyer, and matter the thing enjoyed. Also, the highest object of worship is Krishna and his consort Radha, attended by thousands of gopis; of the Vrindavan; and devotion consists in self-surrender.\n\nŚuddhādvaita is the \"purely non-dual\" philosophy propounded by Vallabha Acharya (1479–1531). The founding philosopher was also the guru of the Vallabhā sampradāya (\"tradition of Vallabh\") or Puṣṭimārga, a Vaishnava tradition focused on the worship of Krishna. Vallabhacharya enunciates that Brahman has created the world without connection with any external agency such as Māyā (which itself is His power) and manifests Himself through the world.[141] That is why Shuddhadvaita is known as \"Unmodified transformation\" or \"Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda\". Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual Selfs and the world. The Jagat or Maya is not false or illusionary, the physical material world is. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a \"part\" (but devoid of bliss) like sparks and fire.[142]\n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1534), stated that the Self or energy of God is both distinct and non-distinct from God, whom he identified as Krishna, Govinda, and that this, although unthinkable, may be experienced through a process of loving devotion (bhakti). He followed the Dvaita concept of Madhvacharya.[143][144][145] This philosophy of \"inconceivable oneness and difference\".\n\n"

            "text": "Early history of Shaivism is difficult to determine.[157] However, the Śvetāśvatara Upanishad (400 – 200 BCE)[158] is considered to be the earliest textual exposition of a systematic philosophy of Shaivism.[159] Shaivism is represented by various philosophical schools, including non-dualist (abheda), dualist (bheda), and non-dualist-with-dualist (bhedābheda) perspectives. Vidyaranya in his works mentions three major schools of Shaiva thought: Pashupata Shaivism, Shaiva Siddhanta and Pratyabhijña (Kashmir Shaivism).[160]\n\nPāśupata Shaivism (Pāśupata, 'of Paśupati') is the oldest of the major Shaiva schools.[161] The philosophy of Pashupata sect was systematized by Lakulish in the 2nd century CE. Paśu in Paśupati refers to the effect (or created world), the word designates that which is dependent on something ulterior. Whereas, Pati means the cause (or principium), the word designates the Lord, who is the cause of the universe, the pati, or the ruler.[162] Pashupatas disapproved of Vaishnava theology, known for its doctrine servitude of Selfs to the Supreme Being, on the grounds that dependence upon anything could not be the means of cessation of pain and other desired ends. They recognised that those depending upon another and longing for independence will not be emancipated because they still depend upon something other than themselves. According to Pāśupatas, Self possesses the attributes of the Supreme Deity when it becomes liberated from the 'germ of every pain'.[163]\n\nPāśupatas divided the created world into the insentient and the sentient. The insentient was the unconscious and thus dependent on the sentient or conscious. The insentient was further divided into effects and causes. The effects were of ten kinds, the earth, four elements and their qualities, colour etc. The causes were of thirteen kinds, the five organs of cognition, the five organs of action, the three internal organs, intellect, the ego principle and the cognising principle. These insentient causes were held responsible for the illusive identification of Self with non-Self. Salvation in Pāśupata involved the union of the Self with God through the intellect.[164]\n\nConsidered normative Tantric Shaivism, Shaiva Siddhanta[165][166] provides the normative rites, cosmology and theological categories of Tantric Shaivism.[167] Being a dualistic philosophy, the goal of Shaiva Siddhanta is to become an ontologically distinct Shiva (through Shiva's grace).[168] This tradition later merged with the Tamil Saiva movement and expression of concepts of Shaiva Siddhanta can be seen in the bhakti poetry of the Nayanars.[169]\n\nKashmir Shaivism arose during the eighth[170] or ninth century CE[171] in Kashmir and made significant strides, both philosophical and theological, until the end of the twelfth century CE.[172] It is categorised by various scholars as monistic[173] idealism (absolute idealism, theistic monism, realistic idealism,[174] transcendental physicalism or concrete monism[174]). It is a school of Śaivism consisting of Trika and its philosophical articulation Pratyabhijña.[175]\n\nEven though, both Kashmir Shaivism and Advaita Vedanta are non-dual philosophies which give primacy to Universal Consciousness (Chit or Brahman),[176] in Kashmir Shavisim, as opposed to Advaita, all things are a manifestation of this Consciousness.[177] This implies that from the point of view of Kashmir Shavisim, the phenomenal world (Śakti) is real, and it exists and has its being in Consciousness (Chit).[178] However, Advaita holds that Brahman is the reality (pure consciousness) and it is inactive (niṣkriya) and the phenomenal world is an appearance (māyā).[179] The objective of human life, according to Kashmir Shaivism, is to merge in Shiva or Universal Consciousness, or to realize one's already existing identity with Shiva, by means of wisdom, yoga and grace.[180]\n\n"
