            "text": "\nThe ouija (/ˈwiːdʒə/ WEE-jə, /-dʒi/ -⁠jee), also known as a spirit board or talking board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the latin alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words \"yes\", \"no\", occasionally \"hello\" and \"goodbye\", along with various symbols and graphics. It uses a planchette (small heart-shaped piece of wood or plastic) as a movable indicator to spell out messages during a séance. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is moved about the board to spell out words. \"Ouija\" is a trademark of Hasbro,[1] but is often used generically to refer to any talking board.\n\nSpiritualists in the United States believed that the dead were able to contact the living and reportedly used a talking board very similar to a modern Ouija board at their camps in the U.S. state of Ohio in 1886 to ostensibly enable faster communication with spirits.[2] Following its commercial introduction by businessman Elijah Bond on 1 July 1890,[1] the Ouija board was regarded as an innocent parlor game unrelated to the occult until American spiritualist Pearl Curran popularized its use as a divining tool during World War I.[3]\n\nParanormal and supernatural beliefs associated with Ouija have been criticized by the scientific community and are characterized as pseudoscience. The action of the board can be most easily explained by unconscious movements of those controlling the pointer, a psychophysiological phenomenon known as the ideomotor effect.[4][5][6][7]\n\nMainstream Christian denominations, including Catholicism, have warned against the use of Ouija boards, holding that they can lead to demonic possession.[8][9] Occultists, on the other hand, are divided on the issue, with some claiming it can be a tool for positive transformation, while others reiterate the warnings of many Christians and caution \"inexperienced users\" against it.[8]\n\n"

            "text": "One of the first mentions of the automatic writing method used in the ouija board is found in China around 1100 AD, in historical documents of the Song dynasty. The method was known as fuji \"planchette writing\". The use of planchette writing as an ostensible means of necromancy and communion with the spirit-world continued, and, albeit under special rituals and supervisions, was a central practice of the Quanzhen School, until it was forbidden by the Qing dynasty.[11]\n\nAs a part of the spiritualist movement, mediums began to employ various means for communication with the dead. Following the American Civil War in the United States, mediums did significant business in allegedly allowing survivors to contact lost relatives. The ouija itself was created and named in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1890, but the use of talking boards was so common by 1886 that news reported the phenomenon taking over the spiritualists' camps in Ohio.[12]\n\nAn employee of Elijah Bond, William Fuld, took over the talking board production. In 1901, Fuld started production of his own boards under the name \"Ouija\".[13] Charles Kennard, the founder of Kennard Novelty Company which manufactured Fuld's talking boards and where Fuld had worked as a varnisher, claimed he learned the name \"Ouija\" from using the board and that it was an Ancient Egyptian word meaning \"good luck\". When Fuld took over production of the boards, he popularized the more widely accepted etymology: that the name came from a combination of the French and German words for \"yes\".[14]\n\n"

            "title": "Scientific investigation",
            "text": "The ouija phenomenon is considered by the scientific community to be the result of the ideomotor response.[4][16][17][18] Michael Faraday first described this effect in 1853, while investigating table-turning.[19][20]\n\nVarious studies have been conducted, recreating the effects of the ouija board in the lab and showing that, under laboratory conditions, the subjects were moving the planchette involuntarily.[16][21] A 2012 study found that when answering yes or no questions, ouija use was significantly more accurate than guesswork, suggesting that it might draw on the unconscious mind.[17] Skeptics have described ouija board users as 'operators'.[22] Some critics have noted that the messages ostensibly spelled out by spirits were similar to whatever was going through the minds of the subjects.[23] According to professor of neurology Terence Hines in his book Pseudoscience and the Paranormal (2003):[24]\n\nSome involuntary movements are known as “Automatism”.[25]\n\nThis correlates with the ideomotor phenomenon because both rely on unconscious movement. The difference is that the ideomotor phenomenon is based on the idea that just the idea that something can happen tricks the brain into doing it. For example, thinking about not moving the planchette leads to the possibility of the planchette moving, which then makes someone unconsciously move the planchette.[25]\n\nOuija boards were already criticized by scholars early on, being described in a 1927 journal as \"'vestigial remains' of primitive belief-systems\" and a con to part fools from their money.[26] Another 1921 journal described reports of ouija board findings as 'half truths' and suggested that their inclusion in national newspapers at the time lowered the national discourse overall.[27]\n\nIn the 1970s ouija board users were also described as \"cult members\" by sociologists, though this was severely scrutinised in the field.[28]\n\n"

            "text": "Since early in the Ouija board's history, it has been criticized by several Christian denominations.[8] The Catholic Church in the Catechism of the Catholic Church in paragraph 2116 explicitly forbids any practice of divination which includes the usage of Ouija boards.[29] Also, Catholic Answers, a Roman Catholic Christian apologetics organization, states that \"The Ouija board is far from harmless, as it is a form of divination (seeking information from supernatural sources).\"[30] Moreover, Catholic bishops in Micronesia called for the boards to be banned and warned congregations that they were talking to demons when using Ouija boards.[31] In a pastoral letter, The Dutch Reformed Churches encouraged its communicants to avoid Ouija boards, as it is a practice \"related to the occult\".[32] The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod also forbids its faithful from using Ouija boards as it teaches that such would be a violation of the Ten Commandments.[33]\n\nIn 2001, Ouija boards were burned in Alamogordo, New Mexico, by fundamentalist groups as \"symbols of witchcraft\".[34][35][36] Religious criticism has also expressed beliefs that the Ouija board reveals information which should only be in God's hands, and thus it is a tool of Satan.[37] A spokesperson for Human Life International described the boards as a portal to talk to spirits and called for Hasbro to be prohibited from marketing them.[38]\n\nThese religious objections to use of the Ouija board have in turn given rise to ostension type folklore in the communities where they circulate.  Cautionary tales that the board opens a door to evil spirits turn the game into the subject of a supernatural dare, especially for young people.[39]\n\n"

            "text": "Ouija boards have been the source of inspiration for literary works, used as guidance in writing or as a form of channeling literary works. As a result of Ouija boards' becoming popular in the early 20th century, by the 1920s many \"psychic\" books were written of varying quality often initiated by ouija board use.[40]\n\nAleister Crowley had great admiration for the use of the ouija board and it played a passing role in his magical workings.[46][47] Jane Wolfe, who lived with Crowley at Abbey of Thelema, also used the Ouija board. She credits some of her greatest spiritual communications to use of this implement. Crowley also discussed the Ouija board with another of his students, and the most ardent of them, Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones): it is frequently mentioned in their unpublished letters. In 1917 Achad experimented with the board as a means of summoning Angels, as opposed to Elementals. In one letter Crowley told Jones:\n\nOver the years, both became so fascinated by the board that they discussed marketing their own design. Their discourse culminated in a letter, dated 21 February 1919, in which Crowley tells Jones,\n\nIn March, Crowley wrote to Achad to inform him, \"I'll think up another name for Ouija.\" But their business venture never came to fruition and Crowley's new design, along with his name for the board, has not survived. Crowley has stated, of the Ouija Board that,[46]\n\n"

            "text": "Ouija boards have figured prominently in horror tales in various media as devices enabling malevolent spirits to spook their users.  Most often, they make brief appearances, relying heavily on the atmosphere of mystery the board already holds in the mind of the viewer, in order to add credence to the paranormal presence in the story being told.\n\nIn the 1960 supernatural horror film 13 Ghosts the family Zorba plays the game \"Ouija, the mystifying oracle.\"\n\nA Ouija board is an early part of the plot of the 1973 horror film The Exorcist.  Using a Ouija board the young girl Regan makes what first appears to be harmless contact with an entity named \"Captain Howdy\". She later becomes possessed by a demon.\n\nBased on Ouija Board, a song and album of the name, Ojah Awake, by Osibisa, was released in 1976.\n\nThe 1986 film Witchboard and its sequels center on the use of Ouija. The 1991 film And You Thought Your Parents Were Weird features use of a Ouija board in an important early scene. What Lies Beneath (2000) includes a séance scene with a board. Paranormal Activity (2007) involves a violent entity haunting a couple that becomes more powerful when the Ouija board is used. Another 2007 film, Ouija, depicted a group of adolescents whose use of the board causes a murderous spirit to follow them, while four years later, The Ouija Experiment portrayed a group of friends whose use of the board opens, and fails to close, a portal between the worlds of the living and the dead.[62] The 2012 film I Am Zozo follows a group of people that run afoul of a demon (based on Pazuzu) after using a Ouija board.[63] The 2014 film Ouija features a group of friends whose use of the board prompts a series of deaths.[64] That film was followed by a 2016 prequel, Ouija: Origin of Evil, which also features the device.\n\nThe British singer Morrissey released a controversial single titled \"Ouija Board, Ouija Board\" in 1989. The lyrics and the video of the song mockingly play with the idea of supernaturally contacting dead persons.\n\nJeremy Gans' nonfiction book, The Ouija Board Jurors: Mystery, Mischief and Misery in the Jury System, based on an article he wrote for the University of Melbourne,[65] recounts an incident in which four jurors sought the help of a Ouija board during a double murder trial, both for guidance and to relieve the stress precipitated by the brutal images of evidence.[65]\n\nThe National Geographic show Brain Games Season 5 episode \"Paranormal\" clearly showed the board did not work when all participants were blindfolded.[66]\n\nThe sitcom Steptoe and Son in Series 8 Episode 6, includes a scene with a Ouija board where Harold briefly fools Albert into believing that they are in contact with the ghost of Adolf Hitler.\n\n"
