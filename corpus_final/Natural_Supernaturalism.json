            "text": "Natural Supernaturalism is one of Thomas Carlyle's philosophical concepts. It derives from the name of a chapter in his novel Sartor Resartus (1833–34) in which it is a central tenet of Diogenes Teufelsdröckh's \"Philosophy of Clothes\". Natural Supernaturalism holds that \"existence itself is miraculous, that life contains elements of wonder that can never be defined or eradicated by physical science.\"\n\nCarlyle conceived of Natural Supernaturalism as a \"new Mythus\"[1] consistent with the discoveries of modern science. Rather than regarding a miracle as \"simply a violation of the Laws of Nature\",[1] Natural Supernaturalism is based on the idea that nature (and its laws) is itself miraculous, being \"of quite infinite depth, of quite infinite expansion\".[1] Rodger L. Tarr writes that \"According to natural supernaturalism, miracles are an extension of truth, not a corruption of it; mysteries are dimensions of science, not a repudiation of it; and wonder is the foundation of logic, not its antagonist.\"[2]\n\nIn The Nuttall Encyclopaedia, Natural Supernaturalism is interpreted as \"the supernatural found latent in the natural, and manifesting itself in it, or of the miraculous in the common and everyday course of things . . . a recognition at bottom, as the Hegelian philosophy teaches, and the life of Christ certifies, of the finiting of the infinite in the transitory forms of space and time.\"[3]\n\n"

            "text": "\nCarlyle thought of Natural Supernaturalism as a corrective to the errors of the Enlightenment, as his journal entry for 13 February 1833 shows:\nHis journal entry for 31 March 1833 reiterated his conviction in the importance of this idea:\nCarlyle wrote a piece dated 15 and 16 November 1852, which James Anthony Froude edited and published as \"Spiritual Optics\" in his biography of Carlyle. In it, Carlyle wrote of \nThe old \"divineness\" Carlyle speaks of is theism, which he compares to the Ptolemaic model, while Natural Supernaturalism is compared to the Copernican model. Just as the Copernican system superseded the Ptolemaic, Natural Supernaturalism represents \"a 'revolution' [in 'our spiritual world'] such as never was before, or at least since letters and recorded history existed among us never was.\"[6]\n\n"

            "text": "Carlyle's theory of Natural Supernaturalism was highly influential on British idealism.[7] James Hutchison Stirling said that the chapter \"contains the very first word of a higher philosophy as yet spoken in Great Britain, the very first English word towards the restoration and rehabilitation of the dethroned Upper Powers.\"[3] Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, two admirers of Carlyle, were also inspired by it. It therefore contributed greatly to American Transcendentalism.[8]\n\nThe term has been used in a literary context (notably by M. H. Abrams)[9] to discuss the work of Margaret Oliphant, Elizabeth Gaskell, Brontë family,[10][11] E. M. Forster,[12] Eric Pankey[13] and William Shakespeare.[14]\n\n"
