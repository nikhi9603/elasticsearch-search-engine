Rinehart to create the models from Crawford's original sketches during the years of 1863â€“1867. The models were stored in the crypt of the Capitol until they were cast in 1904 and installed in 1905.[1]\n\nCrawford created a companion set of bronze doors for the House wing of the Capitol, the George Washington and the Revolutionary War Door.  \n\nIn 1993 the door was analyzed by art conservators from the Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey program and was described as well-maintained.[1]\n\n"
