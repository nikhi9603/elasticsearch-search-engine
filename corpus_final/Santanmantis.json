            "text": "\n\nSantanmantis is an extinct genus of mantises, the sole genus in the family Santanmantidae. The only species, Santanmantis axelrodi , is known from the Crato Formation of Brazil, dating to the late Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous.[1][2][3] It is amongst the most primitive known lineages of mantis.[4] Like other mantises, the forelegs are modified into spined raptorial appendages. When describing a new specimen in 2017, HÃ¶rnig, Haug and Haug proposed that the second set of legs also had spines similar to the forelegs, and also served a raptorial function, but that they were not visible in the fossil due to being broken off.[5] However a response to this paper criticised this assumption, finding that it had little evidence from the fossil itself or from living mantises.[6]\n\n"
