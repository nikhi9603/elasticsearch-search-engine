            "text": "New England is a region of the United States located in the northeastern corner of the country, bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, Canada and the state of New York, consisting of the modern states of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.\n\nIn one of the earliest English settlements in the New World, English Pilgrims from Europe first settled in New England in 1620, in the colony of Plymouth. In the late 18th century, the New England colonies would be among the first North American British colonies to demonstrate ambitions of independence from the British Crown.\n\nNew England produced the first examples of American literature and philosophy and was home to the beginnings of free and compulsory public education. In the 19th century, it played a prominent role in the movement to abolish slavery in the United States. It was the first region of the United States to be transformed by the Industrial Revolution.\n\nHistorically an area in which parts were strongly Republican, it is now a region with one of the highest levels of support for the Democratic Party in the United States, with the majority of voters in every state voting for the Democrats in the 1992, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections, and every state but New Hampshire voting for Al Gore in 2000.\n\n"

            "text": "The midwestern United States, generally referred to as the Midwest, is one of the four geographic regions within the United States that are recognized by the United States Census Bureau.\n\nFive states in the central and inland northeastern US, traditionally considered to be part of the Midwest, can also be classified as being part of the Eastern United States: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. A 2006 Census Bureau estimate put the population at 66,217,736. The United States Census Bureau divides this region into the East North Central States (essentially the Great Lakes States) and the West North Central States.\n\nChicago is the largest city in the region, followed by Columbus and Indianapolis. Chicago has the largest metropolitan statistical area, followed by Detroit, and Minneapolis â€“ Saint Paul. Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan is the oldest city in the region, having been founded by French missionaries and explorers in 1668.\n\nThe term Midwest has been in common use for over 100 years. Another term sometimes applied to the same general region is \"the heartland\". Other designations for the region have fallen into disuse, such as the \"Northwest\" or \"Old Northwest\" (from \"Northwest Territory\") and \"Mid-America\". Since the book Middletown appeared in 1929, sociologists have often used Midwestern cities (and the Midwest generally) as \"typical\" of the entire nation. The region has a higher employment-to-population ratio (the percentage of employed people at least 16 years old) than the Northeast, the West, the South, or the Sun Belt states.\n\nFour of the states associated with the Midwestern United States (Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota) are also traditionally referred to as belonging in part to the Great Plains region.\n\n"

            "text": "The southern United States is a large region of the United States that is sometimes considered to overlap with the Eastern United States, especially in the cases of Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi.\n\nIts unique cultural and historic heritage includes the following aspects:[7][8]\n\nThese aspects among other things, led to \"the South\" developing distinctive customs, literature, musical styles, and varied cuisines, that have profoundly shaped traditional American culture.\n\nA shift from mainly a rural society, to more cities and metropolitan areas becoming urbanized, started to largely form following World War II in the 1940s. Since the late 20th century, certain Southern states and areas have seen great economic growth. This growth has led to many migrants moving to southern states, including many that are in the eastern United States.[9] In 2020, Fortune 500 companies headquartered in eastern southern states included: Virginia with 22, Georgia with 18, Florida with 18, North Carolina with 13, and Tennessee with 10.[10]\n\n"
