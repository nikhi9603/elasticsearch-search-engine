It was discovered on 3 May 1981, by American astronomer Edward Bowell at Lowell's Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, in the United States.[1] The likely elongated S-type asteroid has an exceptionally long rotation period of 908 hours.[4] It was named after the homicidal supercomputer HAL 9000, featured in the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey.[1]\n\n"

            "text": "Hal is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements.[3] Based on osculating Keplerian orbital elements, the asteroid has also been classified as a member of the Flora family (402), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main-belt.[4]\n\nHal orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.8–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,216 days; semi-major axis of 2.23 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic.[2] The asteroid was first observed as 1975 VH3 at Crimea–Nauchnij in November 1975. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa in May 1981.[1]\n\n"

            "text": "Hal is an assumed stony S-type asteroid, based on the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link's (CALL) classification into the Flora family.[4]\n\nIn August 2008, a rotational lightcurve of Hal was obtained from photometric observations by Slovak astronomers Adrián Galád, Jozef Világi, Leonard Kornoš and Štefan Gajdoš at Modra Observatory.[9] Lightcurve analysis gave an exceptionally long rotation period of 908 hours with a high brightness variation of 0.9 magnitude (U=2+). This makes Hal one of the slowest rotators known to exist. In addition, the body's high brightness amplitude is indicative of a non-spherical shape.\n\nAn alternative measurement by French amateur astronomers Pierre Antonini and René Roy gave a much shorter period of 22.68 hours.[8] The result, however, is considered of poor quality by CALL (U=1).[4]\n\nAccording to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Hal measures between 3.61 and 4.134 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.26 and 0.375.[5][6][7] CALL assumes an albedo of 0.24 – derived from 8 Flora, the Flora family's parent body – and calculates a diameter of 4.11 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 14.1.[4]\n\n"

Clarke's novel and Stanley Kubrick's movie 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).[1] HAL stands for Heuristically programmed Algorithmic computer. It is one of the best-known artificial intelligence characters in modern movies. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 4 May 1999 (M.P.C. 34628).[11] The asteroid 4923 Clarke and 10221 Kubrick were named after the writer and movie director, respectively.\n\n"
