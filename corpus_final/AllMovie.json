The AllMovie database is comprehensive, including basic product information, cast and production credits, plot synopsis, professional reviews, biographies, relational links and more.[citation needed]\n\nAllMovie data was accessed on the web at the AllMovie website. It was also available via the AMG LASSO media recognition service, which can automatically recognize DVDs.\n\nIn late 2007, TiVo Corporation acquired AMG for a reported $72 million.[4]\n\nThe AMG consumer facing web properties AllMusic.com, AllMovie.com and AllGame.com were sold by Rovi in August 2013 to All Media Network, LLC. The buyers also include the original founders of SideReel and Ackrell Capital investor Mike Ackrell.[5]\n\nRhythmOne offices are located in San Francisco, California, and Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States.\n\n"
