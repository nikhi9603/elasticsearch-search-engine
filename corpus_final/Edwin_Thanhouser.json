            "text": "Thanhouser was born in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1893, he joined the traveling company of Alessandro Salvini.[1] After Salvini's unexpected death in 1896, Thanhouser managed the Academy Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for the Shubert family and then the Bush Temple Theater in Chicago, Illinois. He formed a stock company that put on hundreds of theatrical productions.\n\nOn February 8, 1900, Thanhouser married actress Gertrude Homan.\n\nIn 1909, Thanhouser and his family moved to New Rochelle, New York, where he leased space in an old wooden skating rink to start the Thanhouser Company. This pioneering movie studio released its first commercial film on March 15, 1910.\n\nThanhouser brought actress Florence La Badie to the company in 1911. From 1911 to 1917, she was the company's most prominent star. In 1912, he sold the film company to group headed by Charles J. Hite. Early in 1915, after Hite's death in an accident, Thanhouser took charge of the company again, but was not as successful as he had been before. The Thanhouser Film Corporation was liquidated in 1920.[2]\n\nEdwin Thanhouser engaged in securities investments and collected art in his later years. He died March 21, 1956.[3]\n\n"
