            "text": "The International Divine Science Association was founded in 1892 in San Francisco, California by religious leader and author Malinda Cramer.[1] The association was \"founded for the promulgation of Divine Science, the God idea of perfect unity, harmony and wholeness, associated together in a unity of spirit, for the healing of nations, and the general good of humanity.\"[2]\n\nThe International Divine Science Association hosted several New Thought Congresses through the 1890s. The association was a loose coalition of Divine Science leaders and centers across the United States,[3] and is credited as the first of several umbrella organizations created at the turn of the 20th century for the New Thought movement.[4]\n\n"
