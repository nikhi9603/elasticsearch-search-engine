            "text": "\n\nNatural horror is a subgenre of horror films that features natural forces,[1] typically in the form of animals or plants, that pose a threat to human characters.\n\nThough killer animals in film have existed since the release of The Lost World in 1925,[2] two of the first motion pictures to garner mainstream success with a \"nature run amok\" premise were The Birds, directed by Alfred Hitchcock and released in 1963; and Jaws, directed by Steven Spielberg and released in 1975. Following Jaws, numerous horror films of a similar narrative were produced, including Grizzly (1976), Piranha (1978), and Alligator (1980).[3]\n\n"
