            "text": "\n\nThe Science Fiction Foundation is a Registered Charity established 1970 in England by George Hay and others. Its purpose is to \"promote science fiction and bring together those who read, write, study, teach, research or archive science fiction in Britain and the rest of the world.\" Science fiction writers Arthur C. Clarke and Ursula K. Le Guin were founding patrons; current patrons are Neil Gaiman and Professor David Southwood.\n\nUntil 1995, the SFF was based in the North East London Polytechnic in Barking, Essex, UK (now the University of East London). For much of this period the Director of the Foundation was Malcolm Edwards, who later moved to Gollancz, and then Orion. \n\n"

The SFF provides a scientific speaker for the annual Eastercon, under the general title of the George Hay Memorial Lecture. It also supplies two judges for the annual Arthur C. Clarke Award. The SFF and the British Science Fiction Association hold their annual general meetings jointly in either May or June.[1]\n\n"
