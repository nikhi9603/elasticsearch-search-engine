            "text": "In the compound eye of invertebrates such as insects and crustaceans, the  pseudopupil appears as a dark spot which moves across the eye as the animal is rotated.[1] This occurs because the ommatidia that one observes \"head-on\" (along their optical axes) absorb the incident light, while those to one side reflect it.[2] The pseudopupil therefore reveals which ommatidia are aligned with the axis along which the observer is viewing.[2]\n\n"

            "text": "The pseudopupil analysis technique is used to study neurodegeneration in insects like Drosophila. An adult Drosophila eye consists of nearly 800 unit ommatidia which are repeated in a symmetrical pattern. Each ommatidium contains 8 photoreceptor cells each of which forms a rhabdomere (7 and 8 rhabdomere are overlapping therefore, only 7 are visible at any given plain focus). Neurodegeneration leads to loss or degradation of photoreceptors.[3] By visualizing and counting the intact rhabdomeres, degradation level can be measured. Thus, analyzing the pseudopupil can permit empirical study of neurodegeneration.\n\n"
