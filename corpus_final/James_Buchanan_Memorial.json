            "text": "The James Buchanan Memorial is a bronze and granite memorial in the southeast corner of  Meridian Hill Park Northwest, Washington, D.C.  It was designed by architect William Gorden Beecher, and sculpted by Maryland artist Hans Schuler.[1][2]\n\n\nCommissioned in 1916, but not approved by the U.S. Congress until 1918, it was completed and unveiled June 26, 1930.  The memorial features a statue of Buchanan bookended by male and female classical figures representing law and diplomacy, engraved with text from a member of Buchanan's cabinet, Jeremiah S. Black: \nThe memorial in the nation's capital complemented an earlier monument, constructed in 1907â€“08 and dedicated in 1911, on the site of Buchanan's birthplace in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania.\n\n"
