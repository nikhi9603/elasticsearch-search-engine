To guard against such accusations, Google at one point in its history had the official motto \"Don't be evil\",[1] however they abandoned that motto for being too obviously frivolous.[3] The New Yorker wrote that \"many food activists consider Monsanto (now Bayer) to be the definitively evil corporation\".[4]\n\nThe Debate over Corporate Social Responsibility wrote, \"For many consumers, Wal-Mart serves as the evil corporation prototype, but record numbers shop at the stores for low prices.\"[5]\n\nIn Japan, a committee of journalists and rights activists issues an annual \"corporate raspberry award\" known as Most Evil Corporation of the Year Award (also called the Black Company Award) to a company \"with a culture of overwork, discrimination and harassment\".[6]\n\n"
