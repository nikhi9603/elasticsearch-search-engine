Often inspired by local folklore,[1][2] Indonesian horror films have been produced in the country since the 1960s. After a hiatus during the Suharto era in the 1990s when censorship affected production, Indonesian horror films continued being produced following Reformasi in 1998.[3][4]\n\n"

            "text": "Ghosts and magical folklore have long been part of Indonesian culture. These later influenced the development of horror films.[5] Kuntilanak are particularly prominent in local horror films.[1]\n\nThomas Barker has argued that films produced after 1998 in Indonesia have been particularly shaped by what he described as the residual \"trauma\" of violence under the preceding New Order era under President Suharto.[1]\n\nIndonesian horror films, particularly the work of Joko Anwar, attracted heightened international attention in the late 2010s, aided by streaming services. Some outlets declared films like Impetigore (2019) as part of a new wave of folk horror films from Southeast Asia.[2][5] Impetigore was Indonesia's submission for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film in its year of release and attracted international recognition, but was not nominated.[2][6]\n\nHBO Asia also released Indonesian-developed horror tevision series Halfworlds.[5]\n\n"
