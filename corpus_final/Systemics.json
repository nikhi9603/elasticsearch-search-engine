It is an attempt at developing logical, mathematical, engineering and philosophical paradigms and frameworks in which physical, technological, biological, social, cognitive and metaphysical systems can be studied and modeled.[citation needed]\n\nThe term \"systemics\" was coined in the 1970s by Mario Bunge and others, as an alternative paradigm for research related to general systems theory and systems science.[1]\n\n"
