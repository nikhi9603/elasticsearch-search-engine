            "text": "An aspect of the traditional Maguzawa Hausa people's religious traditions, Bori became a state religion led by ruling-class priestesses among some of the late precolonial Hausa Kingdoms. When Islam started making inroads into Hausa land in the 14th century, certain aspects of the religion such as idol worship were driven underground. The cult of Tsumbubura in the then-Sultanate of Kano and many other similar Bori cults were suppressed, but Bori survived in \"spirit-possession\" cults by integrating some aspects of Islam. \nThe Bori spirit possession priestesses maintained nominal influence over the Sultanates that replaced the earlier Animist kingdoms. Priestesses communed with spirits through ecstatic dance ritual, hoping to guide and maintain the state's ruling houses. A corps of Bori priestesses and their helpers was led by royal priestess, titled the Inna, or \"Mother of us all\".[3]  The Inna oversaw this network, which was not only responsible for protecting society from malevolent forces through possession dances, but which provided healing  and divination throughout the kingdom.\n\n"

            "text": "Muslim scholars of the early 19th century disapproved of the hybrid religion practised in royal courts, overzealous Muslims were to use this hybridization as an excuse to overthrow the Sultanates and form the Sokoto Caliphate.[4]  With the birth of the Caliphate, Bori practices were partially suppressed in Fula courts.  Bori possession rituals survived in the Hausa refugee states  such as Konni and Dogondutchi (in what is today southern Niger) and in some rural areas of Nigerian Hausaland.  The powerful advisory roles of women, exemplified in the Bori priestesses, either disappeared or were transferred to Muslim women in scholarly, educational, and community leadership roles. British and French colonialism, though, offered little space for women in the official hierarchies of indirect rule, and the formal roles, like the Bori, for women in governance largely disappeared by the mid 20th century.[5]\n\nIn modern Muslim Hausaland, Bori ritual survives in some places assimilated into syncretic practices. The ranks of the pre-Muslim \"babbaku\" spirits of the Maguzaci have been augmented  over time with \"Muslim\" spirits (\"farfaru\"), and spirits of (or representing) other ethnic groups, even those of the European colonialists. The healing and \"luck\" aspects of the performances of Bori members (almost exclusively women) provide new social roles for their rituals and practitioners.[6]  Bori ritual societies, separated from governing structures, provide a powerful corporate identity for the women who belong to them through the practice of traditional healing, as well as through the performance of Bori festival like the girka initiation ritual.[7]\n\nIn spirit possession all over Africa the gender of the possessing spirit takes precedence over the gender of the possessed. A man possessed by a female spirit for ritual purposes takes the personality of a woman, while a woman possessed by a male spirit takes the personality of a man. This often has no relevance to everyday living. Bori possession cults exist in countries all over Africa under different names. They are, however, found only among certain ethnic groupings and are totally absent from most.\n\n'\n\n"
