            "text": "Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism (CR) is an umbrella term for Polytheistic Reconstructionist traditions which are based in one of the specific cultures of the Celtic-speaking peoples (such as Gaelic Polytheists or Welsh or Gaulish Reconstructionists).[4] Celtic Reconstructionists strive to practice a historically accurate and authentic tradition, based on the folklore and living traditions in the Celtic Nations and the diaspora as well as primary sources in the Celtic languages.[5][6] They reject the eclecticism and cultural appropriation of the broader Neopagan community.[7]\n\nCeltic Neoshamanism is a modern spiritual tradition that combines elements from Celtic myth and legend with Michael Harner's core shamanism.[8] Proponents of Celtic Shamanism believe that its practices allow a deeper spiritual connection to those with a northern European heritage.[9] Authors such as Jenny Blain have argued that \"Celtic Shamanism\" is a \"construction\" and an \"ahistoric concept\".[10]\n\nNeo-Druidism is a form of modern spirituality or religion that generally promotes harmony and worship of nature gods.  Many forms of modern Druidism are Neopagan religions, whereas others are instead seen as philosophies that are not necessarily religious in nature.[11][12] Arising from the 18th century Romanticist movement in England, which glorified the ancient Celtic peoples of the Iron Age, the early Neo-druids aimed to imitate the Iron Age Celtic priests who were also known as druids. At the time, little accurate information was known about these ancient priests, and the modern druidic movement has no actual connection to them, despite some claims to the contrary made by modern druids.[13]\n\nCeltic Wicca is a modern tradition of Wicca that incorporates some elements of Celtic mythology.[14][15][16] It employs the same basic theology, rituals and beliefs as most other forms of Wicca.[14][15] Celtic Wiccans use the names of Celtic deities, mythological figures, and seasonal festivals within a Wiccan ritual structure and belief system,[14][17] rather than a historically Celtic one.[16][18]\n\n"
