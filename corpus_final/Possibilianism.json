Harris writes that the position Eagleman espouses \"is, simply, atheism.\"  Harris calls on Eagleman \"to admit that “possibilianism,” this middle position of yours, is just a piece of performance art, rather than a serious thesis.\"[22]\nIn response, Eagleman stated that \"[Harris'] braggadocio appears to be emblematic of the neo-atheist posture, and confirms why I don't feel completely at home in that camp.\"[23]\nJournalist Steve Volk in the Huffington Post suggested that Harris and Eagleman should be \"new allies\": \"If we're going to get beyond the typical exchanges between new atheists and the religious, I'd argue that it's through figures like Eagleman and Harris that we will find the most productive path: men who are eager to use science while demonstrating a capacity to consider ideas from other areas of human experience and systems of thought.\"[24]\n\n"
