            "text": "The United States Congress authorized the Adams Memorial Foundation to proceed with the design and construction of a memorial on November 5, 2001.[1] The foundation was authorized to raise private funds to construct a memorial on federal land in Washington, D.C. Once established, the memorial was then to be turned over to the federal government. On December 2, 2002, Congress amended this legislation to permit the Adams Memorial to be constructed within Area 1, the central core of the District of Columbia centered on the National Mall.[1]\n\nThe Commemorative Works Clarification and Revision Act of 2003 (CWCRA), however, gave the Adams Memorial Foundation and other memorial efforts then under way just seven years to raise the funds and begin construction. When the memorial foundation was unable to raise the funds, Congress passed legislation on October 30, 2009, giving the Adams Memorial effort until September 30, 2010, to complete its fundraising. On December 2, 2009, Congress passed legislation applying the CWCRA to the Adams Memorial, although the clock began running with passage of the Area I authorization. Congress extended the deadline for fund-raising yet again on May 24, 2010, giving the memorial until December 2, 2013, to finish its efforts.[2]\n\nAuthorization for the Adams Memorial expired on December 2, 2013, without a memorial having begun construction.[2] Congress again reauthorized the memorial on July 22, 2014, extending the deadline to December 2, 2020.[3] Following the continued failure of the foundation to select a location and raise funds,[4] the March 2019 John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act established an Adams Memorial Commission to establish the memorial, with members appointed by Congress and the president.[5][4] President Trump made two of four presidential appointments in fall 2020, Timothy Harleth[6] and Jackie Gingrich Cushman, daughter of former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich.[7]\n\nAs of March 2022 the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate President pro tempore Patrick Leahy have not yet made any of their eight appointments. According to Section 2406 of the 2019 authorizing statute, while the presidential appointments may be any member of the public, the congressional appointments can be only current elected members of the House and Senate.  The commission expires December 2, 2025.\n\n"
