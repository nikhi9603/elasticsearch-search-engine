            "text": "In ufology, a close encounter is an event in which a person witnesses an unidentified flying object. This terminology and the system of classification behind it were first suggested in astronomer and UFO researcher J. Allen Hynek's 1972 book The UFO Experience: A Scientific Inquiry.[1] Categories beyond Hynek's original three have been added by others but have not gained universal acceptance, mainly because they lack the scientific rigor that Hynek aimed to bring to ufology.[2]\n\nSightings more than 150 metres (500 ft) from the witness are classified as \"Daylight Discs,\" \"Nocturnal Lights,\" or \"Radar/Visual Reports.\"[3] Sightings within about 150 metres (500 ft) are subclassified as various types of \"close encounters.\" Hynek and others argued that a claimed close encounter must occur within about 150 metres (500 ft) to greatly reduce or eliminate the possibility of misidentifying conventional aircraft or other known phenomena.[4]\n\nHynek's scale became well known after being referenced in a 1977 film, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which is named after the third level of the scale. Promotional posters for the film featured the three levels of the scale, and Hynek himself makes a cameo appearance near the end of the film.\n\n"

            "text": "Hynek devised a sixfold classification for UFO sightings:[5][6] They are arranged according to increasing proximity:\n\nLights in the night sky[7]\n\nUFOs seen in the daytime, generally having discoidal or oval shapes[8]\n\nUFO reports that have radar confirmation—these supposedly try to offer harder evidence that the objects are real, although radar propagation can be occasionally discredited due to atmospheric propagation anomalies[9]\n\nVisual sightings of an unidentified flying object, seemingly less than 500 feet (150 m) away, that show an appreciable angular extension and considerable detail[10]\n\nA UFO event in which a physical effect is alleged; this can be interference in the functioning of a vehicle or electronic device, animals reacting, a physiological effect such as paralysis or heat and discomfort in the witness, or some physical trace like impressions in the ground, scorched or otherwise affected vegetation, or a chemical trace[10]\n\nUFO encounters in which an animated entity is present—these include humanoids, robots, and humans who seem to be occupants or pilots of a UFO[11]\n\nUFO researcher Ted Bloecher proposed six subtypes for the close encounters of the third kind in Hynek's scale:[12]\n\n"

            "text": "A Close Encounter of the Fourth Kind is a UFO event in which a human is abducted by a UFO or its occupants.[13] This type was not included in Hynek's original close encounters scale.[14]\n\nHynek's erstwhile associate Jacques Vallee argued in the Journal of Scientific Exploration that the \"Fourth Kind\" should refer to \"cases when witnesses experienced a transformation of their sense of reality\", so as to also include non-abduction cases where absurd, hallucinatory or dreamlike events are associated with UFO encounters.[15][unreliable source?]\n\nThe film The Fourth Kind makes reference to this category.\n\nA Close Encounter of the Fifth Kind is a UFO event claiming direct communication between aliens and humans.[13]\n\n"
