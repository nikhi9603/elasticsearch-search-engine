            "text": "Nature worship also called naturism[1] or physiolatry[2] is any of a variety of religious, spiritual and devotional practices that focus on the worship of the nature spirits considered to be behind the natural phenomena visible throughout nature.[3] A nature deity can be in charge of nature, a place, a biotope, the biosphere, the cosmos, or the universe. Nature worship is often considered the primitive source of modern religious beliefs[4][5] and can be found in pantheism, theism, panentheism, deism, polytheism, animism, totemism, shamanism, paganism, Saridharam,sarnaism, and Wicca. Common to most forms of nature worship is a spiritual focus on the individual's connection and influence on some aspects of the natural world and reverence towards it.[6] Due to their admiration of nature, the works of Carl Linnaeus and Charles Wordsworth were viewed as nature worship.[7][8]\n\n"
