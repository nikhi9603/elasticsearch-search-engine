            "text": "Computation can be seen as a purely physical process occurring inside a closed physical system called a computer. Examples of such physical systems are digital computers, mechanical computers, quantum computers, DNA computers, molecular computers, microfluidics-based computers, analog computers, and wetware computers.\n\nThis point of view has been adopted by the physics of computation, a branch of theoretical physics, as well as the field of natural computing.\n\nAn even more radical point of view, pancomputationalism (inaudible word), is the postulate of digital physics that argues that the evolution of the universe is itself a computation.\n\nThe classic account of computation is found throughout the works of Hilary Putnam and others. Peter Godfrey-Smith has dubbed this the \"simple mapping account.\"[3] Gualtiero Piccinini's summary of this account states that a physical system can be said to perform a specific computation when there is a mapping between the state of that system and the computation such that the \"microphysical states [of the system] mirror the state transitions between the computational states.\"[4]\n\nPhilosophers such as Jerry Fodor[5] have suggested various accounts of computation with the restriction that semantic content be a necessary condition for computation (that is, what differentiates an arbitrary physical system from a computing system is that the operands of the computation represent something).  This notion attempts to prevent the logical abstraction of the mapping account of pancomputationalism, the idea that everything can be said to be computing everything.\n\nGualtiero Piccinini proposes an account of computation based on mechanical philosophy. It states that physical computing systems are types of mechanisms that, by design, perform physical computation, or the manipulation (by a functional mechanism) of a \"medium-independent\" vehicle according to a rule. \"Medium-independence\" requires that the property can be instantiated[clarification needed] by multiple realizers[clarification needed] and multiple mechanisms, and that the inputs and outputs of the mechanism also be multiply realizable. In short, medium-independence allows for the use of physical variables with properties other than voltage (as in typical digital computers); this is imperative in considering other types of computation, such as that which occurs in the brain or in a quantum computer. A rule, in this sense, provides a mapping among inputs, outputs, and internal states of the physical computing system.[6]\n\n"
