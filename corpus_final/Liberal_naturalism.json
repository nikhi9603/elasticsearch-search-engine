            "text": "Liberal naturalism is a heterodox form of philosophical naturalism that lies in the conceptual space between scientific (or reductive) naturalism and supernaturalism. It allows that one can respect the explanations and results of the successful sciences without supposing that the sciences are our only resource for understanding humanity and our dealings with the world and each other.\n\nThe term \"liberal naturalism\" was introduced in 2004 by Mario De Caro & David Macarthur[1] and, independently, by Gregg Rosenberg.[2] This form of naturalism has been ascribed to Immanuel Kant.[3] In De Caro's work liberal naturalism is developed as a mild metaphysical realism; whereas in Macarthur's work liberal naturalism is associated with metaphysical quietism and opens into a philosophy of the manifest image. \n\n"

Explaining such things might require non-scientific non-supernatural resources according to this form of naturalism. So, rather than tailoring their ontology to the posits of the successful sciences, as scientific naturalists do, liberal naturalists recognise the prima facie irreducible reality of everyday objects that are part of what Wilfrid Sellars called \"the manifest image\".[4]\n\nLiberal naturalism is a \"liberal\"[5] or \"catholic\"[6] naturalism for several reasons each of which contrasts with scientific naturalist orthodoxy:\n\n"
