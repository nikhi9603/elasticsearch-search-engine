            "text": "Rethink Robotics was founded in 2008[2] as a startup aiming to create low-cost robots.[4] In 2012, they released the robot Baxter.[5] In 2015, they released a smaller and more flexible counterpart to Baxter, Sawyer, that was designed to perform smaller, more detailed tasks.[5]\n\nIn 2016, they released their collaborative robots (cobots) worldwide. These robots were designed to be easy to set up and work alongside, rather than replace, humans in factory environments.[6]\n\nIn October 2018, Rethink Robotics ceased operations and sold off its assets. Other companies picked up support for the robots.[7]\n\nIn October 2019, one year after the acquisition of assets through the German HAHN Group, Rethink Robotics launched the new Sawyer BLACK Edition.[12] The headquarters of Rethink Robotics moved from Rheinb√∂llen to Bochum in mid 2020, and signed a partnership with Siemens.[13][14]\n\n"
