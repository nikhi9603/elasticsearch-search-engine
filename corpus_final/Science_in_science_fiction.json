            "text": "Science in science fiction is the study or analysis of how science is portrayed in works of science fiction, including novels, stories, and films.  It covers a large range of topics, since science takes on many roles in science fiction.  Hard science fiction is based on engineering or the \"hard\" sciences (for example, physics, astronomy, or chemistry), whereas soft science fiction is based on the \"soft\" sciences, and especially the social sciences (anthropology, sociology, psychology, political science, and so on).  \n\nLikewise, the accuracy of the science portrayed spans a wide range - sometimes it is an extrapolation of existing technology, sometimes it is a realistic or plausible portrayal  of a technology that does not exist, but which is plausible from a scientific perspective; and sometimes it is simply a plot device that looks scientific, but has no basis in science. Examples are:\n\nCriticism and commentary on how science is portrayed in science fiction is done by academics from science, literature, film studies, and other disciplines; by literary critics and film critics; and by science fiction writers and sci fi fans and bloggers.\n\n"
