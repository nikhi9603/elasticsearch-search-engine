            "text": "Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814) was one of the founding figures of German idealism, which developed from the theoretical and ethical writings of Immanuel Kant.[1] His philosophy forms a bridge between the ideas of Kant and those of the German idealist Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.\n\nFichte distinguished the finite or empirical ego from the pure or infinite ego. The activity of this \"pure ego\" can be discovered by a \"higher intuition\".[1][note 1]\n\nAccording to Michael Whiteman, Fichte's philosophical system \"is a remarkable western formulation of eastern mystical teachings (of Advaita).\"[1]\n\nIn 1812, Arthur Schopenhauer started to use the term \"the better consciousness\", a consciousness that \"lies beyond all experience and thus all reason, both theoretical and practical (instinct).\"[2]\n\nAccording to Yasuo Kamata, Schopenhauer's idea of \"the better consciousness\" finds its origin in Fichte's idea of a \"higher consciousness\" (höhere Bewusstsein)[3] or \"higher intuition\",[4] and also bears resemblance to Schelling's notion of \"intellectual intuition\".[3] According to Schopenhauer himself, his notion of a \"better consciousness\" was different from Schelling's notion of \"intellectual intuition\", since Schelling's notion required intellectual development of the understanding, while his notion of a \"better consciousness\" was \"like a flash of insight, with no connection to the understanding.\"[3]\n\nAccording to Schopenhauer,\n\nDifferent types of higher states of consciousness can arise individually or in various combinations. The list of known types of higher states of consciousness:\n\n"

            "text": "Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834) made a distinction between lower and higher self-consciousness.[7][8] In Schleirmacher's theology, self-consciousness contains \"a feeling that points to the presence of an absolute other, God, as actively independent of the self and its 'world'.\"[9] For Schleiermacher, \"all particular manifestations of piety share a common essence, the sense of dependency on God as the outside 'infinite'.\"[9] The feeling of dependency, or \"God-consciousness\", is a higher form of consciousness.[8] This consciousness is not \"God himself\",[10] since God would then no longer be \"an infinite infinite, but a finite infinite, a mere projection of consciousness.\"[10]\n\nFor Schleiermacher, the lower self-consciousness is \"the animal part of mankind\", which includes basic sensations such as hunger, thirst, pain and pleasure, as well as basic drives and pleasures, and higher self-consciousness is, in the words of Dawn DeVries, \"the part of the human being that is capable of transcending animal instincts\",[7] and the \"point of contact with God\". Bunge describes this as \"the essence of being human\".[7]\n\nWhen this consciousness is present, \"people are not alienated from God by their instincts\".[7] The relation between the lower and the higher consciousness is akin to \"Paul's struggle of the spirit to overcome the flesh\",[7] or the distinction between the natural and the spiritual side of human beings.[8]\n\nThe idea of a \"wider self walled in by the habits of ego-consciousness\"[11]  and the search for a \"higher consciousness\" was manifested in 19th century movements such as Theosophy,[11] New Thought,[11] Christian Science,[11] and Transcendentalism.[12]\n\nThe 19th-century Transcendentalists saw the entire physical world as a representation of a higher spiritual world.[13] They believed that humans could elevate themselves above their animal instincts, attain a higher consciousness, and partake in this spiritual world.[14]\n\nAccording to Blavatsky, who founded the Theosophical Movement,\n\nBlavatsky refers to Fichte in her explanation of Theosophy:\n\nThe idea of \"lower\" and \"higher consciousness\" has gained popularity in modern popular spirituality.[16] According to James Beverley, it lies at the heart of the New Age movement.[17]\n\nIntegral theorist Ken Wilber has tried to integrate eastern and western models of the mind, using the notion of \"lower\" and \"higher consciousness\". In his book The Spectrum of Consciousness Wilber describes consciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end, and more profound types of awareness at higher levels.[18] In later works he describes the development of consciousness as a development from lower consciousness, through personal consciousness, to higher transpersonal consciousness.[16]\n\nClairvoyant Edgar Cayce referred to higher consciousness as \"the Christ pattern\". Similarly, channeler Paul Selig refers to it as \"Christ consciousness\". In Selig's words, this is a \"higher energy\" at which \"You realize that God is the frequency of every cell in your being.\" This is not necessarily a tenet of Christianity, but the conviction that a regular person can be attuned to reach the same level of spirituality as did the historical Jesus.[19]\n\n"

            "text": "Gerald Edelman, in his 'Theory of Consciousness', distinguishes higher consciousness, or \"secondary consciousness\" from \"primary consciousness\", defined as simple awareness that includes perception and emotion. Higher consciousness in contrast, \"involves the ability to be conscious of being conscious\", and \"allows the recognition by a thinking subject of his or her own acts and affections\".  Higher consciousness requires, at a minimal level semantic ability, and \"in its most developed form, requires linguistic ability, or the  mastery of a whole system of symbols and a grammar\".[20]\n\n"
