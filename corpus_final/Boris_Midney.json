            "text": "Midney was born in Moscow to a conductor and pianist father and classical singer mother. He studied classical composition and clarinet also teaching himself to play saxophone.[1]\n\nIn 1964 he defected from the USSR via the US embassy in Japan.[2] Midney's main reason for leaving the USSR was the censorship of art.[3] After arriving in New York, he formed The Russian Jazz Quartet with whom he recorded an album for Impulse Records.[2] In the 1960s, Midney married Tania Armour from the Armour & Company family.[4]\n\nLater, Midney became a prolific composer and producer of disco music although he rarely was credited under his own name.[5] Using guises such as USA-European Connection, Masquerade, Double Discovery, Companion and Festival, Midney produced a large body of disco music. He is recognised as being among the first producers to take full advantage of 48-track recording and one of the creators of the Eurodisco genre.[6]\n\n\nDescribing his disco music, critics Alan Jones and Jussi Kantonen wrote:\nIn 1999 Midney released Trancetter, a progressive trance album.[6]\n\n"
