He then worked as a computer engineer at a power plant in Shanxi province.[8]\n\n"

            "text": "Liu's writing is influenced by fiction.  He cites British authors George Orwell and Arthur C. Clarke as important literary influences.[9] He was labeled the first cyberpunk Chinese author after his novel, China 2185, was published in 1989.[10] Liu's most famous work, The Three-Body Problem, was published in 2007 (it is the first novel in the Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy). American author Ken Liu's 2014 translation (published by Tor Books) won the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Novel.[11] Liu Cixin thus became the first author from Asia to win Best Novel.[12] The German translation (which included some portions of the original text not included in the English translation) followed in 2016.[13] Ken Liu also translated the third volume of The Three-Body Problem series, Death's End, in 2016.[14] Death's End was a 2017 Hugo Award for Best Novel finalist and won a 2017 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.\n\nLiu's three novels had been a sensation of Chinese science fiction literature within Chinese territory and internationally. In 2012, even the winner of the Nobel Prize of Literature, Mo Yan, acclaimed the remarkable originality of Liu Cixin.[15] Liu's fiction focuses primarily on problems such as social inequality, scientific development and ecological limitations that impact humanity.[16] Chinese science fiction, then, acts as a vehicle that expresses hope for social change and modernization to contextualize the process of globalization.[17] With the novels revolving around China, not implying the favourability to this country but to remind that China and as well as other countries face the same threats that endanger civilization and the world.[16] Further, proper translation of Chinese science fiction and literature in general would help to overcome the divisions between different cultures.[17] This would facilitate the integration of new ideas and allow Chinese culture to be an essential part of world literature.[17]\n\nA cinematic adaptation of The Three-Body Problem has been filmed, but its release has been indefinitely postponed.[18] In March 2018, Amazon was rumored to be negotiating for the rights to the project.[19][20] However, YooZoo Pictures released a statement in response stating that it was the \"sole owner of the rights for film and TV series adaptations.\"[20] Although it \"was originally scheduled to be released in 2017,\" the project \"was postponed indefinitely due to the company's internal shuffling and the rumored 'bad quality' of the film's first cut.\"[20] In June 2019, it was reported that work had begun on an animated adaptation,[21] and in 2020, October Media announced another adaptation in the works.[22]\n\nThe cinematic adaptation of his short story The Wandering Earth was released in China on February 5, 2019,[23] which became the second highest-grossing film in the Chinese box office within 2 weeks.[24]\n\nThe science-fiction comedy film Crazy Alien was adapted from his science fiction The Rural Teacher [zh], which has grossed 2.2 billion at the box office, making it the fifteenth film in Chinese film history with a box office exceeding 2 billion.[25]\n\nUS streaming platform Netflix announced in September 2020 that it had ordered an English-language series based on Liu's well-known trilogy The Three-Body Problem. Liu would serve as a consulting producer on the project. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss were named as writers and executive producers. Other members of the creative team included executive producer Rian Johnson, Ram Bergman, Bernadette Caulfield, Nena Rodrigue, Lin Qi, and Rosamund Pike.[26]  The Netflix television adaptation started production in early November 2021, with a scheduled finish date in August 2022.[27]\n\nChinese video platform Tencent Video is also working on a series based on The Three Body problem and released the first trailer in June 2022.[28]\n\n"

            "text": "Liu is married and has a daughter.[29]\n\nAccording to a June 2019 interview and profile article by The New Yorker, Liu avoids talking about politics. In the same article, Liu argued that democracy was not appropriate for modern China, and individual liberty and freedom of governance is \"not what Chinese people care about\", adding \"If you were to loosen up the country a bit, the consequences would be terrifying.\" He expressed support for policies such as the one-child policy and the Xinjiang internment camps, saying \"the government is helping their economy and trying to lift them out of poverty\".[30]\n\nLiu's remarks in the New Yorker interview were questioned by five Republican U.S. senators in a letter to Netflix in September 2020. The letter asks whether Netflix was aware of Liu's remarks and demands a justification for proceeding with the adaptation of The Three-Body Problem.[31][32][33][34] Netflix responded that Liu was not the creator of the show, and that Liu's comments \"are not reflective of the views of Netflix or of the show's creators, nor are they part of the plot or themes of the show\".[35]\n\n"
