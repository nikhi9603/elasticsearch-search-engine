            "text": "\n\nPublishing is the activity of making information, literature, music, software and other content available to the public for sale or for free.[1] Traditionally, the term refers to the creation and distribution of printed works, such as books, newspapers, and magazines. With the advent of digital information systems, the scope has expanded to include electronic publishing such as ebooks, academic journals, micropublishing, websites, blogs, video game publishing, and the like.\n\nPublishing may produce private, club, commons or public goods and may be conducted as a commercial, public, social or community activity.[2] The commercial publishing industry ranges from large multinational conglomerates such as Bertelsmann, RELX, Pearson and Thomson Reuters[3] to thousands of small independents. It has various divisions such as trade/retail publishing of fiction and non-fiction, educational publishing (k-12) and academic and scientific publishing.[4] Publishing is also undertaken by governments, civil society and private companies for administrative or compliance requirements, business, research, advocacy or public interest objectives.[5] This can include annual reports, research reports, market research, policy briefings and technical reports. Self-publishing has become very common.\n\n\"Publisher\" can refer to a publishing company or organization, or to an individual who leads a publishing company, imprint, periodical or newspaper.\n\n"

            "text": "Publishing became possible with the invention of writing, and became more practical upon the introduction of printing. Prior to printing, distributed works were copied manually, by scribes. Due to printing, publishing progressed hand-in-hand with the development of books.\n\nThe Chinese inventor Bi Sheng made movable type of earthenware circa 1045, but there are no known surviving examples of his work. The Korean civil servant Choe Yun-ui, who lived during the Goryeo Dynasty, invented the first metal moveable type in 1234–1250 AD [6]\n\nAround 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, Johannes Gutenberg invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce and more widely available.\n\nEarly printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as incunables or incunabula. \"A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in A.D. 330.\"[7]\n\nEventually, printing enabled other forms of publishing besides books. The history of modern newspaper publishing started in Germany in 1609, with publishing of magazines following in 1663.\n\nMissionaries brought printing presses to sub-Saharan Africa in the mid-18th century.[8]\n\nHistorically, publishing has been handled by publishers, although some authors self-published.[9] The establishment of the World Wide Web in 1989 soon propelled the website into a dominant medium of publishing. Wikis and Blogs soon developed, followed by online books, online newspapers, and online magazines.\n\nSince its start, the World Wide Web has been facilitating the technological convergence of commercial and self-published content, as well as the convergence of publishing and producing into online production through the development of multimedia content.\n\nA U.S.-based study in 2016 that surveyed 34 publishers found that the publishing industry in the US in general is overwhelmingly represented by straight, able bodied, white females.[10] Salon described the situation as \"lack of diversity behind the scenes in book world\".[11] A survey in 2020 by the same group found there has been no statistical significant change in the lack of diversity since the 2016 survey four years earlier.[12] Lack of diversity in the American publishing industry has been an issue for years. Within the industry, there was the least amount of diversity in higher level editorial positions.[13]\n\n"

            "text": "The publishing process includes creation, acquisition, copy editing, production, printing (and its electronic equivalents), marketing, and distribution. With books, binding follows upon the printing process. It involves folding the printed sheets, \"securing them together, affixing boards or sides to it, and covering the whole with leather or other materials\".[14]\n\n"

            "text": "There are four major types of publishers in book publishing:\n\nDerided in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica as \"a purely commercial affair\" that cared more about profits than about literary quality,[19] publishing is like any business, with a need for the expenses not to exceed the income. Publishing is now a major industry with the largest companies Reed Elsevier and Pearson PLC having global publishing operations.\n\nSome businesses maximize their profit margins through vertical integration; book publishing is not one of them. Although newspaper and magazine companies still often own printing presses and binderies, book publishers rarely do. Similarly, the trade usually sells the finished products through a distributor who stores and distributes the publisher's wares for a percentage fee or sells on a sale or return basis.\n\nThe advent of the Internet has provided the electronic way of book distribution without the need of physical printing, physical delivery and storage of books.\n\nWithin the electronic book path, the publishing house's role remains almost identical.  The process of preparing a book for e-book publication is exactly the same as print publication, with only minor variations in the process to account for the different mediums of publishing.  While some costs, such as the discount given to retailers (normally around 45%)[20] are eliminated, additional costs connected to ebooks apply (especially in the conversion process), raising the production costs to a similar level.[citation needed]\n\nPrint on demand is rapidly becoming an established alternative to traditional publishing.\n\nBook clubs are almost entirely direct-to-retail, and niche publishers pursue a mixed strategy to sell through all available outlets — their output is insignificant to the major booksellers, so lost revenue poses no threat to the traditional symbiotic relationships between the four activities of printing, publishing, distribution, and retail.\n\n"

            "title": "Industry sub-divisions",
            "text": "Newspapers are regularly scheduled publications that present recent news, typically on a type of inexpensive paper called newsprint. Most newspapers are primarily sold to subscribers, through retail newsstands or are distributed as advertising-supported free newspapers. About one-third of publishers in the United States are newspaper publishers.[21]\n\nNominally, periodical publishing involves publications that appear in a new edition on a regular schedule. Newspapers and magazines are both periodicals, but within the industry, the periodical publishing is frequently considered a separate branch that includes magazines and even academic journals, but not newspapers.[21]  About one-third of publishers in the United States publish periodicals (not including newspapers).[21] The library and information science communities often refer to periodicals as serials.\n\nThe global book publishing industry accounts for over $100 billion of annual revenue, or about 15% of the total media industry.[22]\n\nFor-profit publishers of books that serve the general public are often referred to as \"trade publishers.\" Book publishers represent less than a sixth of the publishers in the United States.[21] Most books are published by a small number of very large book publishers, but thousands of smaller book publishers exist. Many small- and medium-sized book publishers specialize in a specific area. Additionally, thousands of authors have created publishing companies and self-published their own works. Within book publishing, the publisher of record for a book is the entity in whose name the book's ISBN is registered. The publisher of record may or may not be the actual publisher.\n\nIn 2013, Penguin (owned by Pearson) and Random House (owned by Bertelsmann) merged, narrowing the industry to a handful of big publishers as it adapted to digital media.[23] The merger created the largest consumer book publisher in the world, with a global market share of more than 25 percent.[24] Approximately 60%[25] of English-language books are produced through the \"Big Five\" publishing houses: Penguin Random House, Hachette, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster, and Macmillan. In November 2020, ViacomCBS agreed to sell Simon & Schuster, the third largest book publisher in the United States, to Penguin Random House in a deal that will create the first mega publisher.[23] On November 2, 2021, the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit (U.S. v. Bertelsmann SE & CO. KGaA, et al.) to block the merger on anti-trust grounds,[26] and on October 31st, 2022, the  D.C. District Court ruled in favour of the Department of Justice, filing a permanent injunction on the merger. [27]\n\nDirectory publishing is a specialized genre within the publishing industry. These publishers produce mailing lists, telephone books, and other types of directories.[21] With the advent of the Internet, many of these directories are now online.\n\nTechnically, radio, television, cinemas, VCDs and DVDs, music systems, games, computer hardware and mobile telephony publish information to their audiences. Indeed, the marketing of a major film often includes a novelization, a graphic novel or comic version, the soundtrack album, a game, model, toys and endless promotional publications.\n\nSome of the major publishers have entire divisions devoted to a single franchise, e.g., Ballantine Del Rey Lucasbooks has the exclusive rights to Star Wars in the United States; Random House UK (Bertelsmann)/Century LucasBooks holds the same rights in the United Kingdom. The game industry self-publishes through BL Publishing/Black Library (Warhammer) and Wizards of the Coast (Dragonlance, Forgotten Realms, etc.). The BBC has its publishing division that does very well with long-running series such as Doctor Who. These multimedia works are cross-marketed aggressively and sales frequently outperform the average stand-alone published work, making them a focus of corporate interest.[28]\n\n"

            "text": "Accessible publishing uses the digitization of books to mark-up books into XML and then produces multiple formats from this to sell to customers, often targeting those with difficulty reading. Formats include a variety larger print sizes, specialized print formats for dyslexia,[29] eye tracking problems and macular degeneration, as well as Braille, DAISY, audiobooks and e-books.[30]\n\nGreen publishing means adapting the publishing process to minimise environmental impact. One example of this is the concept of on-demand printing, using digital or print-on-demand technology. This cuts down the need to ship books since they are manufactured close to the customer on a just-in-time basis.[31]\n\nA further development is the growth of on-line publishing where no physical books are produced. The ebook is created by the author and uploaded to a website from where it can be downloaded and read by anyone.\n\nAn increasing number of authors are using niche marketing online to sell more books by engaging with their readers online.[32]\n\n"

A book that is privished may be referred to as \"killed\". Depending on the motivation, privishing may constitute breach of contract, censorship,[38] or good business practice (e.g., not printing more books than the publisher believes will sell in a reasonable length of time).\n\n"
