            "text": "\nA minority religion is a religion held by a minority of the population of a country, state, or region. Minority religions may be subject to stigma or discrimination. An example of a stigma is using the term cult with its extremely negative connotations for certain new religious movements.[1] People who belong to a minority religion may be subject to discrimination and prejudice, especially when the religious differences correlate with ethnic differences.\n\nLaws are made in some countries to protect the rights of religious minorities, such as protecting the minorities' culture and to promote harmony with the majority.\n\n"
