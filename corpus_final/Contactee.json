            "text": "Contactees are persons who claim to have experienced contact with extraterrestrials. Some claimed ongoing encounters, while others claimed to have had as few as a single encounter. Evidence is anecdotal in all cases.\n\nAs a cultural phenomenon, contactees perhaps had their greatest notoriety from the late 1940s to the late 1950s, but individuals continue to make similar claims in the present. Some have shared their messages with small groups of followers, and many contactees have written books, published magazine and newspaper articles, issued newsletters or spoken at UFO conventions.\n\nThe contactee movement has seen serious attention from academics and mainstream scholars. Among the earliest was the 1956 study, When Prophecy Fails by Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken, and Stanley Schachter, which analyzed the phenomenon. There have been at least two university-level anthologies of scientific papers regarding the contactee movements.\n\nContactee accounts are generally different from those who allege alien abduction, in that while contactees usually describe positive experiences involving humanoid aliens, abductees rarely describe their experiences positively.\n\n"

Allen Hynek described contactees thus:\n\nContactees became a cultural phenomenon in the 1940s and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s, often giving lectures and writing books about their experience. The phenomenon still exists today. Skeptics often hold that such \"contactees\" are deluded or dishonest in their claims. Susan Clancy wrote that such claims are \"false memories\" concocted out of a \"blend of fantasy-proneness, memory distortion, culturally available scripts, sleep hallucinations, and scientific illiteracy\".[2]\n\nContactees usually portrayed aliens as more or less identical in appearance and mannerisms to humans. The aliens are also almost invariably reported as disturbed by the violence, crime, and wars that infest the earth, and by the possession of various earth nations of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons.\nCurtis Peebles summarizes the common features of many contactee claims:[3]\n\n"

            "text": "As early as the 18th century, people like Emanuel Swedenborg were claiming to be in psychic contact with inhabitants of other planets. 1758 saw the publication of Concerning Earths in the Solar System, in which Swedenborg detailed his alleged journeys to the inhabited planets. J. Gordon Melton notes that Swedenborg's planetary tour stops at Saturn, the furthest planet discovered during Swedenborg's era, he did not visit then unknown Uranus, Neptune or Pluto.[4]\n\nIn 1891, Thomas Blott's book The Man From Mars was published. The author claimed to have met a Martian in Kentucky. Unusually for an early contactee, Blott reported that the Martian communicated not via telepathy, but in English.[5]\n\nGeorge Adamski, who later became probably the most prominent contactee of the UFO era, was one contactee with an earlier interest in the occult. Adamski founded the Royal Order of Tibet in the 1930s. Writes Michael Barkun, \"His [later] messages from the Venusians sounded suspiciously like his own earlier occult teachings.\"[6]\n\nChristopher Partridge notes, importantly, that the pre-1947 contactees \"do not involve UFOs\".[7]\n\nIn support of their claims, early 1950s contactees often produced photographs of the alleged flying saucers or their occupants. A number of photos of a \"Venusian scout ship\" by George Adamski and identified by him as a typical extraterrestrial flying saucer were noted to suspiciously bear a remarkable resemblance to a type of once commonly available chicken egg incubator, complete with three light bulbs which Adamski said were \"landing gear\".[8]\n\nFor over two decades, contactee George Van Tassel hosted the annual \"Giant Rock Interplanetary Spacecraft Convention\" in the Mojave Desert.[9]\n\n"

            "text": "Even in ufology—itself subject to at best very limited and sporadic mainstream scientific or academic interest—contactees were generally seen as the lunatic fringe, and serious ufologists subsequently avoided the subject, for fear it would harm their attempts at serious study of the UFO phenomenon.[10][11] Jacques Vallée notes, \"No serious investigator has ever been very worried by the claims of the 'contactees'.\"[12]\n\nCarl Sagan has expressed skepticism about contactees and alien contact in general, remarking that aliens seem very happy to answer vague questions but when confronted with specific, technical questions they are silent:\n\nSome time after the phenomenon had waned, Temple University historian David M. Jacobs noted a few interesting facts: the accounts of the prominent contactees grew ever more elaborate, and as new claimants gained notoriety, they typically backdated their first encounter, claiming it occurred earlier than anyone else's. Jacobs speculates that this was an attempt to gain a degree of \"authenticity\" to trump other contactees.[14]\n\n"
