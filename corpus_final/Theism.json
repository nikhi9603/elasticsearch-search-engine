            "text": "The term theism derives from the Greek θεός[9] (theós) or theoi meaning \"god\" or \"gods\". The term theism was first used by Ralph Cudworth (1617–1688).[10] In Cudworth's definition, they are \"strictly and properly called Theists, who affirm, that a perfectly conscious understanding being, or mind, existing of itself from eternity, was the cause of all other things\".[11]\n\n"

            "text": "Monotheism (from Greek μόνος) is the belief in theology that only one deity exists.[12] Some modern day monotheistic religions include Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Baháʼí Faith, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, some Sects of Hinduism, and Eckankar.\n\nPolytheism is the belief that there is more than one god.[13]\nIn practice, polytheism is not just the belief that there are multiple gods; it usually includes belief in the existence of a specific pantheon of distinct deities.\n\nWithin polytheism there are hard and soft varieties[citation needed]:\n\nPolytheism is also divided according to how the individual deities are regarded:\n\nThe distinction between these two beliefs may be ambiguous and unhelpful, or a significant point of division.[15] Pantheism may be understood a type of Nontheism, where the physical universe takes on some of the roles of a theistic God, and other roles of God viewed as unnecessary.[16]\n\nDeism typically rejects supernatural events (such as prophecies, miracles, and divine revelations) prominent in organized religion. Instead, Deism holds that religious beliefs must be founded on human reason and observed features of the natural world, and that these sources reveal the existence of a supreme being as creator.[18]\n\nAutotheism is the viewpoint that divinity, whether also external or not, is inherently within 'oneself' and that one has the ability to become godlike. Indian religions like Buddhism and Jainism are Autotheistic. This can be in a selfless way, a way following the implications of statements attributed to ethical, philosophical, and religious leaders (such as Mahavira).\n\nAutotheism can also refer to the belief that one's self is a deity, within the context of subjectivism. Hindus use the term, \"aham Brahmāsmi\" which means, \"I am Brahman\".[19]\n\nMormons teach a type of Autotheism called Exaltation, where humans can attain godhood.[20]\n\nNon-theism is the belief in no gods or god.\n\nAtheism is the lack of belief in supernatural powers such as deities, gods/goddesses, or messiahs.  Some atheists express an active disbelief or rejection of the existence of such entities.\n\n"
