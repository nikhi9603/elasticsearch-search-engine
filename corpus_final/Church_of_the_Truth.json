His aim was to create a place which would heal the total human: mind, body and soul, thus creating a full awakening of the Christ within.\n\nThe Church of Truth is part of the loosely formed New Thought movement. The Church of Truth has a vision: \"We are an inclusive community of Christ-centered, prosperous, healing ministries, which through affirmative prayer and support, empower all people to awaken the Christ within.\"\n\n"
