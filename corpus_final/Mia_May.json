            "text": "Mia May was born Hermine Pfleger on 2 June 1884 in Vienna, the daughter of Johann Pfleger, a baker, and Albine Pfleger (née. Steinfelder). Her older sister, Maria (1879–1958), who acted under the stage name Mitzi Telmont, was the second wife of the comedian Heinrich Eisenbach.\n\nShe made her stage debut at Jantsch Theater at the age of 5, playing child roles until she was 14. She continued her stage career as a teenager, taking on the stage name Herma Angelot, and appearing at the Apollo Theater as an actress and singer. While attending high school, she began receiving ballet lessons from Louise Übermasser.\n\nIn 1902, she married Julius Otto Mandl, and seven weeks later gave birth to their daughter Eva Maria Mandl.[3] Herma Angelot then became Mia May, and when her husband entered the film business, he took on the name Joe May.\n\nIn 1911, May traveled to Hamburg to Wilhelm Bendiner's Neues Operettentheater. In 1912, the May family settled in Berlin, where her husband had been hired as a film director. She made her film debut in In der Tiefe des Schachtes (1912), which her husband directed, followed by the 1913 short Life's Temptations, and Die geheimnisvolle Villa (1914), which was also their daughter Eva May's film debut.\n\nIn 1915, Joe May founded the film company May-Film Gmb, which Mia May became managing director of.[4] She is also credited with writing Your Big Secret (1918).\n\nMay appeared in films such as Hilde Warren und der Tod (1917), which was written by Fritz Lang, The Beggar Countess (1918), The Platonic Marriage (1919), Veritas Vincit (1919), and Tragedy of Love (1923) with Emil Jannings and a young Marlene Dietrich. May said of Dietrich, \"I remember her as very funny and engaging, attractive and original. No man could resist her. She went everyone with a monocle and a boa of five red foxes. On other occasions, she would wear a wolf fur throw. People would follow her in the streets, they would laugh at her, but she fascinated them.\"[5]\n\nFrom 1919 to 1920, she starred in the 8 part film serial Mistress of the World. For a time, she was as popular as actresses Asta Nielsen, Henny Porten, and Pola Negri.[6]\n\nMay's final screen appearance was in The Love Letters of Baroness S (1924). She retired in 1924 after her daughter Eva May committed suicide.\n\nUpon the rise of the Nazis in 1933, Mia May and Joe May emigrated to America via France. \nIn 1949, Mia and Joe opened the Blue Danube restaurant in Los Angeles, but it was unsuccessful, and closed shortly after.[7][8][9] Previously, Joe May had opened the Wiener Bar in Hollywood in 1937.[10]\n\nMia May died on 28 November 1980 in Los Angeles.\n\n"
