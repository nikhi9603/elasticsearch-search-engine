The 82nd Airborne Division took over the facility in August 2003 and created Forward Operating Base St. Mere. On March 24, 2004, the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force took control from the 82nd Airborne and renamed the FOB, Camp Fallujah in order to better associate the camp with the local Iraqi city.[1] On January 12, 2009, the Government of Iraq took control of the compound from the United States military.[2]\n\nThe camp is adjacent to the other major U.S. base in Fallujah, the former Ba'athist resort Camp Baharia (also known as \"Dreamland\").\n\n"
