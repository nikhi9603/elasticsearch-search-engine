Many of the things that constitute Somali mythology today are traditions whose accuracy have faded away with time or have transformed considerably with the coming of Islam to the Horn of Africa.\n\nThe culture of venerating saints and the survival of several religious offices in modern Somalia show that old traditions of the region's ancient past had a significant impact on Islam and Somali literature in later centuries. Similarly, practitioners of traditional Somali medicine and astronomy also adhere to remnants of an old cultural belief system that once flourished in Somalia and the wider Horn region.\n\n"

            "text": "The Somali people in pre-Islamic times are believed to have adhered to a complex belief System, with a set of deities superseded by a single all-powerful figure called Eebbe/Waaq (God, also known in Oromo as Waaq). Religious temples dating from antiquity known as Taallo were the centers where important ceremonies were held led by a Wadaad priest. Waaq was a pre-Islamic Sky God associated with water/rain, fertility, sacred trees, animals, nature, peace and harmony. It is construed in Somali with words like Bar waaqo (\"bountiful\"), Ceel Waaq (a town's name) and Cabu Waaq ( a town in central Somalia mostly populated by the Marehan clan).[1][2]\n\n"

Many epics support the legend of Araweello as a defining Female leader in her era.\n\n"

Waaq in itself is a Somali word and are used to name places such as Abudwaaq (\"Worshiper of God\"), Ceel Waaq (\"Well of God\") and other similar towns with the name Waaq in it suggest a relation to the old Waaq worship practiced in the Horn. The Tomb of Arrawelo is another popular mythological place in Somalia said to be the final resting place of Queen Arrawelo. In modern times, it is considered an important place for Somali women.\n\n"
