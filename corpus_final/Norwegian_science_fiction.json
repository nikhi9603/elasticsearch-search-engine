            "text": "Science fiction literature was established in Norway in the mid-1960s, mainly by Jon Bing and Tor Åge Bringsværd. They dominated the genre and reached relatively high public interest until the late 1970s. Johannes H. Berg Jr. is a noteworthy contributor to Norwegian science fiction literature from the 1970s until his death in 2004. Among contemporary authors is Margret Helgadottir, who writes science fiction in English.\n\nProto-science fiction can be found as far back as the 18th century in Norway. Best known is the novel Niels Klim's Underground Travels by the playwright Ludvig Holberg. Also, Henrik Wergeland wrote at least one play that can be considered science-fiction-esque: De sidste kloge (\"The Last of the Wise\"), set on the planet Terra Nova.\n\n"
