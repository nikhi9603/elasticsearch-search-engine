Such buildings usually feature Mount Vernon's iconic piazza but might also copy its cupola, distinct dimensions, red-white-and-green color scheme, asymmetrical window distribution, or three-part organization.[1]\n\nGeorge Washington's Mount Vernon and architectural historian Lydia Mattice Brandt began a digital humanities project that collects information on Mount Vernon replicas. It crowd-sources information and locates Mount Vernon look-alikes on an interactive map.\n\n"
