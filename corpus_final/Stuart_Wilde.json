            "text": "Wilde was born in Farnham, England. He has a twin sister, Dee Dee,[5] who became well known in Britain for her weekly appearances on Top of the Pops with the dance troupe Pan's People. He was educated at St. George's College, Weybridge, Surrey. After his schooling he joined the English Stage Company in Sloane Square, London. A year later he opened a jeans business in Carnaby Street London, at the height of the Swinging Sixties where he enjoyed considerable commercial success.[6]\n\n"

            "text": "He studied alternative religions and Taoist philosophy for five years from the age of twenty-eight, and when he was thirty-three, he emigrated to the United States of America where he lived in Laguna Beach, California with his first wife Cynthia. He wrote his first book, Miracles, in 1983.[3]\n\nShortly thereafter he began a career as a lecturer appearing mainly in New Thought Churches and at New Age conferences. In the 1990s he toured regularly with Deepak Chopra, Dr. Wayne Dyer and Louise Hay,[7] appearing at venues such as the Sydney Entertainment Centre.\n\nWilde's London street slang and comedic way[8] of presenting self-empowerment and spiritual ideas continue to attract a wide and diverse audience.[2][8] He's been called ahead of his time,\" 'the teacher's teacher' because of the influence he has had on other writers and lecturers in the field\", provocative, poignant, controversial, funny, and his writing \"timeless\".[2][9]\n\nHe remains a figure for progressive thought in metaphysics[citation needed] and the field of human potential, and is often quoted with references to his work appearing across a wide swath of international cultural, business, and educational forums from the Kennedy Center for the Arts',[10] interviews with American hip-hop artists and slam poets,[11] international investment conferences,[12] and the pages of international media such as CNET's \"Top 10 List: Human Development Gurus\"[13] and The Times of India's \"Sunday Life\" section.[14]\n\n"

            "title": "Principal claims",
            "text": "Wilde's principal claims are that, while many citizens may seem to be normal, acquiescing to the status quo, there exists a vast population of what he calls Fringe Dwellers whose mind and soul do not align to the constraints of life in regular society that Wilde called Tick-Tock.[2][16] Wilde believed through use of the theta state of meditation (4–7 cycles per second), humans can better control their emotional life and their bio-rhythms, and begin to see visions, and that those visions and extrasensory feeling will lead to a greater balance and more freedom.[2][17][18]\n\nTo that end, he emphasized the importance of going beyond the habit of struggling, and advocated the need for financial freedom,[2] themes stated in his books Life was Never Meant to be a Struggle (1987), The Trick to Money is Having Some (1989),[19] and The Little Money Bible (1998).\n\nIn Affirmations (1986), Wilde laid out systems of self-talk that empower an individual to change their core beliefs.[20] His book Sixth Sense (2000) discusses practical techniques for developing extrasensory perception.\n\nHe earned both praise and criticism for his later works which advanced controversial concepts such as other dimensions, dematerialization, and Morph worlds.[9]\n\nHis most avant garde claims are based on the idea that Paul Dirac's hypothesis of parallel antiparticle worlds is, in fact, correct, and that humans adept at trance meditation can become aware of spiritual dimensions placed at 90° from them left and right—dimensions, Wilde said, that follow Hawking's theory of transverse waves of light. Wilde acknowledged there was no empirical data to support his claim, but anecdotal evidence, gathered from more than two-thousand people whom he taught, stated they had experienced such transcendental 90° perception which led him to conclude these worlds exist.[21]\n\nGrace, Gaia, and the End of Days (2009) maps out coordinates for these spiritual dimensions and offers \"a twenty-first century understanding of grace and spiritual evolution\"—and tools to activate it in one's life. In a 2009 interview Wilde said, \"Grace is a golden light, pure love, a divine energy, seen coming from these inner spiritual worlds. It is data-driven and laced with trillions of bits of fractal information that will guide you and help you evolve. The human system is configured to read this fractal data through visions and extra sensory intuitive feelings.\"[21] Serenity and balance developed through regular trance meditation enable access this 'pure information', which he called stream of consciousness from a 'Higher Knowing', 'The Source', 'God'.[21]\n\nWhile Wilde believed humans are multi-dimensional beings who possess both the celestial light and the dark, he posited they gravitate to one or the other based on inner feelings, thoughts, and actions. The quality of these feelings, moreover, determine the spiritual dimension an aspect of oneself will reside in any moment.[21][22] Redemption (and a life of love and serenity) is possible for all by choosing the ways of the celestial. On the larger plane, he believed the light will eventually overcome the dark and advised aligning with the forces of light, the forces of God. He laid out techniques for doing so through cultivation of tenderness, generosity, respect, \"the soft eye\", mindfulness, meditation, time in nature and with animals,[23] and avoidance of dark places, people, and media that sell specialness, fear, degradation, and greed. Move from the cold cerebral mind into the warmth of heart and feeling. \"There is strength in softness. Remember, It's all backwards,\" he was oft quoted.[21]\n\nWilde was a staunch supporter of peace in the world, the command to live and let live,[9] animal rights and vegetarianism. Tom Lishman eulogised him this way—\n\n"
