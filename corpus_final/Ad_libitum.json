Libido is the etymologically closer cognate known in English.\n\n"

Baroque music, especially, has a written or implied ad libitum, with most composers intimating the freedom the performer and conductor have.\n\nFor post-Baroque classical music and jazz, see cadenza.\n\n"

            "text": "\"Ad-lib\" is used to describe individual moments during live theatre when an actor speaks through their character using words not found in the play's text. When the entire performance is predicated on spontaneous creation, the process is called improvisational theatre.\n\nIn film, the term ad-lib usually refers to the interpolation of unscripted material in an otherwise scripted performance. For example, in interviews, Dustin Hoffman says he ad-libbed the now famous line, \"I'm walking here! I'm walking here!\" as \"Ratso\" Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy.\n\nLive performers such as television talk-show hosts sometimes deliver material that sounds ad-libbed but is actually scripted. They may employ ad-lib writers to prepare such material.[1] Some actors are also known for their ability or tendency to ad-lib, such as Peter Falk (of the series Columbo), who would ad-lib such mannerisms as absent-mindedness while in character.\n\nThe HBO sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm by Seinfeld co-creator Larry David primarily uses retroscripting and ad lib instead of scripted dialogue.\n\n"
