            "text": "The ideomotor phenomenon is a psychological phenomenon wherein a subject makes motions unconsciously. Also called ideomotor response (or ideomotor reflex) and abbreviated to IMR, it is a concept in hypnosis and psychological research.[2] It is derived from the terms \"ideo\" (idea, or mental representation) and \"motor\" (muscular action). The phrase is most commonly used in reference to the process whereby a thought or mental image brings about a seemingly \"reflexive\" or automatic muscular reaction, often of minuscule degree, and potentially outside of the awareness of the subject. As in responses to pain, the body sometimes reacts reflexively with an ideomotor effect to ideas alone without the person consciously deciding to take action. The effects of automatic writing, dowsing, facilitated communication,[3] applied kinesiology, and ouija boards have been attributed to the phenomenon.[4][5]\n\nThe associated term \"ideo-dynamic response\" (or \"reflex\") applies to a wider domain, and extends to the description of all bodily reactions (including ideo-motor and ideo-sensory responses) caused in a similar manner by certain ideas, e.g., the salivation often caused by imagining sucking a lemon, which is a secretory response. The notion of an ideo-dynamic response contributed to James Braid's first neuropsychological explanation of the principle through which suggestion operated in hypnotism.\n\n"

            "text": "With the rise of Spiritualism in 1840s, mediums devised and refined a variety of techniques for communicating, ostensibly, with the spirit world including table-turning and planchette writing boards (the precursor to later Ouija boards). These phenomena and devices quickly became the subject of scientific investigation.[6][7]\n\nThe term Ideomotor was first used in a scientific paper discussing the means through which these spiritualistic phenomena produced effect, by William Benjamin Carpenter in 1852,[8] hence the alternative term \"Carpenter effect\".  Carpenter derived the word ideomotor from the components ideo, meaning \"idea\" or \"mental representation\", and motor, meaning \"muscular action\".  In the paper, Carpenter explained his theory that muscular movement can be independent of conscious desires or emotions.[citation needed]\n\n\nCarpenter was a friend and collaborator of James Braid, the founder of modern hypnotism. Braid soon adopted Carpenter's ideo-motor terminology, to facilitate the transmission of his most fundamental views, based upon those of his teacher, the philosopher Thomas Brown, that the efficacy of hypnotic suggestion was contingent upon the subject's concentration upon a single (thus, \"dominant\") idea. In 1855, Braid explained his decision to abandon his earlier term \"mono-ideo-motor\", based on Carpenter's (1852) \"ideo-motor principle\", and adopt the more appropriate and more descriptive term \"mono-ideo-dynamic\". His decision was based upon suggestions made to Carpenter (in 1854) by their friend in common, Daniel Noble, that the activity that Carpenter was describing would be more accurately understood in its wider applications (viz., wider than pendulums and ouija boards) if it were to denominated the \"ideo-dynamic principle\":[9]\nScientific tests by the English scientist Michael Faraday, Manchester surgeon James Braid,[11] the French chemist Michel Eug√®ne Chevreul, and the American psychologists William James and Ray Hyman have demonstrated that many phenomena attributed to spiritual or paranormal forces, or to mysterious \"energies\", are actually due to ideomotor action. Furthermore, these tests demonstrate that \"honest, intelligent people can unconsciously engage in muscular activity that is consistent with their expectations\".[12] They also show that suggestions that can guide behavior can be given by subtle clues (Hyman 1977).\n\nSome operators claim to use ideomotor responses to communicate with a subject's \"unconscious mind\" using a system of physical signals (such as finger movements) for the unconscious mind to indicate \"yes\", \"no\", \"I don't know\", or \"I'm not ready to know that consciously\".[13]\n\nA simple experiment to demonstrate the ideomotor effect is to allow a hand-held pendulum to hover over a sheet of paper. The paper has words such as \"yes\", \"no\", and \"maybe\" printed on it. Small movements in the hand, in response to questions, can cause the pendulum to move towards the words on the paper. This technique has been used for experiments in extrasensory perception, lie detection, and ouija boards. This type of experiment was used by Kreskin[14] and has also been used by illusionists such as Derren Brown.[15]\n\n"

            "text": "It is strongly associated with the practice of analytical hypnotherapy based on \"uncovering techniques\" such as Watkins' \"affect bridge\",[17] whereby a subject's \"yes\", \"no\", \"I don't know\", or \"I don't want to answer\" responses to an operator's questions are indicated by physical movements rather than verbal signals; and are produced per medium of a pre-determined (between operator and subject) and pre-calibrated set of responses.[18]\n\n"
