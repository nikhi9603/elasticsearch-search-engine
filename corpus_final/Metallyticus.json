            "text": "\n\nMetallyticus is a genus of praying mantis. It is the only genus in the monotypic family Metallyticidae. They are mostly found in South-East Asia. The species of the genus are dark, somewhat flattened and cockroach-like, and often with a cuticle that is reflective and metallic in appearance.[1][2]\n\nThe phylogenetic position of Metallyticidae relative to other mantis families has been studied using both morphological and molecular characters, but consensus on its placement has not been achieved.[3] Along with the genera Chaeteessa and Mantoida, Metallyticus is considered a member of the basal Mantodea,[3] though some scientists consider the application of this term to extant species to be misleading.[4] Metallyticidae species have several autapomorphic traits, including their metallic coloration and the enlarged spine on their front legs. They also have many plesiomorphic traits, including a relatively short pronotum and full wings in both sexes.[3]\n\nOf the five species, M. splendidus and M. violaceus are the most abundant. Most specimens for scientific study have been found in Sumatra, Borneo, Java, and the Malay Peninsula.[3]\n\nSpecies in this family are distinct from other mantises in their method of prey capture; Metallyticus species typically dart to capture prey, remaining close to the ground, rather than waiting to ambush. These species are usually found in or under bark of decaying trees.[3]\n\n"
