            "text": "The Washington Before Boston Medal was the first medal commissioned by the Continental Congress and, being struck in gold, is the first Congressional Gold Medal.[1]\n\nOn March 25, 1776, Congress passed a resolution which read:\n\nPierre-Simon-Benjamin Duvivier was commissioned to design and engrave the medal. Creating a medal during the American Revolutionary War was not a priority, and the medal was eventually struck in Paris and presented to Washington on March 21, 1790.[2] The medal is currently possessed by the Boston Public Library.[3]\n\n"
