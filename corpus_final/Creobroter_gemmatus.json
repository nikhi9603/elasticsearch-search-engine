Females can be cannibalistic but males are fairly communal. Though infrequent, cannibalism among C. germmatus is nevertheless more common than among other flower mantises.\n\nThey moult 8 times to become an adult and can take between 2 and 5 months to mature depending on food and temperature. They are the smallest yet most widespread Creobroter species. They make easy pets with proper care and it is said there is a 90% survival rate among nymphs.[1][2]\n\n"
