At Austin, Texas it was found on flowerheads of the slender aster (Symphyotrichum subulatum.[6] At Cedar Creek, Texas it was found in meadows of little bluestem grass (Schizachyrium scoparium) at night but was unnoticeable by day.[5]\n\n"

            "text": "This mantis does not breed sexually and the adults, which are all female, lay their eggs without the involvement of a male. The clutch of eggs is protected by an ootheca or egg-case. In most mantid species, each mantid nymph emerges from its own hole in the egg-case, but in this species, one of the ootheca is drawn out into a point and all the nymphs emerge through this. The nymphs are similar to the adults in appearance and go through a series of moults as they grow.[5]\n\nMantids are generally ambush predators, but little is known about the diet of this mantis. It can be found at night about a foot off the ground, climbing higher among the grasses if disturbed. Judging by its size, it probably feeds on grasshoppers.[5]  This species also enjoys eating grass dwelling walkingsticks which are often slender instead of robust and have few defenses against the mantids.\n\n"
