They undergo a radical metamorphosis, with the larval and adult stages differing considerably in their structure and behaviour. This is called holometabolism, or complete metamorphism.\n\n"

            "text": "The Endopterygota are distinguished from the Exopterygota by the way in which their wings develop. Endopterygota (literally \"internal winged forms\") develop wings inside the body and undergo an elaborate metamorphosis involving a pupal stage. Exopterygota (\"external winged forms\") develop wings on the outside their bodies and do not go through a pupal stage. The latter trait is plesiomorphic, however, as it is found also in groups such as Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), which are not Neoptera, but more basal among insects.\n\n"
