            "text": "Esther Hicks (née Weaver, born March 5, 1948) is an American inspirational speaker, channeler, and author. She has co-written nine books with her late husband Jerry Hicks, presented numerous workshops on the law of attraction with Abraham-Hicks Publications and appeared in the original version of the 2006 film The Secret.[1] The Hicks' books, including the series The Law of Attraction, are – according to Esther Hicks – \"translated from a group of non-physical entities called Abraham\". Hicks describes what she is doing as tapping into \"infinite intelligence\".[2][3]\n\n"

            "text": "Esther Weaver was born in Coalville, Utah on March 5, 1948. At age 20 she met her first husband, and from that marriage were born two daughters, one of whom (Tracy) works with her.[3][4]  In 1976 she met Jerry Hicks, then a successful Amway distributor, and they married four years later. In his early life Jerry Hicks had been a circus acrobat for two years in Cuba, and then, beginning in 1948, had toured for 20 years as a musician, master of ceremonies, and comedian.[1][2][3] Jerry Hicks died November 18, 2011, from cancer. He was 85 years old.[5]\n\n"

            "text": "According to Esther and Jerry Hicks, \"Abraham\" consists of a group of entities that are \"interpreted\" by Esther Hicks. Abraham has described themselves as \"a group consciousness from the non-physical dimension\". They have also said, \"We are that which you are. You are the leading edge of that which we are. We are that which is at the heart of all religions.\" Abraham has said through Esther that, whenever one feels moments of great love, exhilaration, or pure joy, that is the energy of source and that is who Abraham is.[citation needed]\n\nA large part of Hicks' work centers around the law of attraction, a concept which William Walker Atkinson (1862–1932) wrote about in his book Thought Vibration or the Law of Attraction in the Thought World (1906).[7]\n\n"

            "text": "Esther Hicks narrated and appeared in the original version of the film The Secret, as well as being a central source of the film's inspiration.[3] The footage featuring Hicks was removed from the later \"Extended Edition\" after the film's creator Rhonda Byrne, who has been involved in contractual disputes and litigation regarding the film, rescinded the original contract covering Hicks' participation,[4] and asked that Hicks relinquish her \"intellectual property rights in these areas forever\".[8] In an open letter posted on the internet, Hicks stated that she had been \"uncomfortable with what felt to us like a rather aggressive marketing campaign,\" and that ultimately Abraham gave her the following advice: \"Whenever you are given an ultimatum that says, 'if you don't do this, then we will have to do such and such,' it is best that you just let it go and move on. Otherwise there is always another, and this, and this, and this.\"[8] The letter doesn't condemn Byrne, but clarifies why Hicks no longer appears in The Secret.\n\nHicks has since posted a video on YouTube further explaining her discomfort with The Secret and finally, her decision to discontinue her involvement with the film.[9]\n\n"
