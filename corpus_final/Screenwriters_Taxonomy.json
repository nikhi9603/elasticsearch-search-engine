Williams developed the Screenwriters Taxonomy in 2017 to create a common language of creative collaboration for filmmakers.[1]  Williams’ central thesis in The Screenwriters Taxonomy: A Roadmap to Collaborative Storytelling is that the term “genre” is used so broadly to describe films that the modern use of the word has become meaningless.[2]  The Screenwriter's Taxonomy proposes seven categories for discussing the creative process of telling cinematic stories.[3]\n\n"

There are ten different brands of drama, and a dozen brands of comedy.[10]\n\n"

The fifty macro genres identified by Williams are (although he contends that there are probably more):[12]\n\nAn example of how the “mystery” macro genre would pair with each super genre:\n\n"

Therefore, each macro genre has its own set of possible micro genres.  For example, the “biography” macro genre has at least six possible micro genres:[13]\n\nThe micro genres for each macro are as follows:\n\n"

            "title": "Pathway",
            "text": "Pathways describe the trajectory of how the audience will move through the story.  Regardless of genre, each story sends their protagonist(s) along a specific trajectory (or pathway).   The pathway becomes a subconscious roadmap for the audience – a tool to guide them through the story.   There are twenty different pathways, including the traditional pathway with which American audiences are most familiar. The traditional pathway has five elements:\n\nThese five elements take an audience through a film in a familiar way. As an example, in the 1991 Academy Award Winning film Silence of the Lambs, the audience joins Clarice Starling on her metamorphosis from fledgling to experienced FBI agent.[16]  They go through the story with her. What she learns, they learn.  She starts in the world of law enforcement, makes her way into the world of the criminally insane, and eventually returns, victorious, to her home at the FBI. The visceral pay-off for the audience comes from her mental battle with Dr. Lecter and Buffalo Bill.  In the end, Agent Starling is rewarded for the battle that she waged.\n\nIn addition to the traditional pathway, there are nineteen others:\n\nThese nineteen pathways diverge from the traditional pathway in one of seven ways:[17]\n\nThe protagonist may battle an antagonist, but the more important struggle is often against some larger force. The audience's enjoyment comes from watching this larger force destroy the protagonist.  In this pathway, the protagonist is typically destroyed.  Or, if he survives, the survival itself is the victory. Rarely does the protagonist “come out on top”.\n\nPathways in this category:\n\nThe protagonist may confront an antagonist, but the central focus is watching the protagonist endure an extreme personal tragedy.  The protagonist is often destroyed emotionally, and rarely “comes out on top”.  Additionally, in this pathway, the hero's attention to personal tragedy diverts them from their original heroic journey.\n\nPathway in this category:\n\nThe protagonist rarely returns home – literally or metaphorically.\n\nPathways in this category:\n\nThese Pathways to not use a single protagonist to carry the story.  Instead, they split the story equally across multiple protagonists. Each story is shorter because each character has a full story with their own beginning, middle and end.  Protagonists may or may not confront an antagonist.  If they do, the antagonist is often a broad, two-dimensional character. The audience is more engaged in the emotional relationship between the various protagonists than they are in external conflicts.\n\nPathways in this category:\n\nThese pathways do not use a single protagonist to carry the story.  Instead, they split the story equally across multiple protagonists.  Protagonists may or may not confront a specific antagonist.  Often the story revolves around an event that the group must endure, or a mission that the group must accomplish.  Each character serves as the antagonist in their colleague's story.  What sets this pathway apart from the simple “Multi-Protagonist” pathway is how the backstory is provided to the audience. In this pathway, the audience is perpetually playing “catch up”.  The protagonists know each other, and have known each other for some time.  However, the audience joins the characters’ story already in progress.\n\nPathways in this category:\n\nIn these pathways, the audience knows more than the protagonist. The audience doesn't learn information as much as they remember information.  Enjoyment comes from reminiscence, and the central pay-off comes from watching the protagonist go through an awakening, not from battling a powerful antagonist.  \n\nPathways in this category:\n\nIn most stories, the protagonist battles an antagonist: another flesh-and-blood sentient being. These pathways diverge from this expectation by telling stories of a protagonist's battle against something non-sentient. These are stories of circumstance, where the “antagonist” does not set out to willfully engage and destroy the protagonist. Yet, the protagonist's life or livelihood is in danger, nonetheless.\n\nPathways in this category:\n\n"

            "title": "Point of View",
            "text": "From the outset of any story, the screenwriter must decide how much information the audience will have.  Point of View (POV) as a decision tree with three central questions.\n\nBy finding the answers that best help to tell their story, screenwriters determine a POV for their screenplay.[18]  The Screenwriters Taxonomy boils the answers to these questions down into the five most common POVs:\n\nThe characters are unaware that a film is being made, and so have no narrative voice.  Instead, the filmmaker crafts a story by taking us on an omniscient tour of characters and events, designed to intrigue and entertain the audience by showing the perfect piece of the story at the most impactful time. This type of filmmaking is almost always objective, since the very nature of watching a movie is predicated on the filmmaking being truthful.\n\nThe story is viewed through the main character's perspective. The story is often biased, and the actions told in retrospect – in order to tell the “bigger story” in which the primary character has been caught.  Alan Ball used this technique in his final draft of American Beauty.[19]\n\nA greater sense of objectivity is created when the protagonist's POV is limited. Although the story is told from a single person's subjective interpretation of events, this POV may seem more authentic and objective in certain situation.\n\nSecondary limited is unusual, but not out of the question.  In fact, some of the most famous stories of all time – like the tales of Sherlock Holmes – are told from a secondary, limited perspective.  Of course, the story is about the primary character (Sherlock Holmes), but it is told from the perspective of a secondary character (Dr. Watson).  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as the author, reveals only what Watson would logically know or be able to infer about how Sherlock Holmes solved the crime.\n\nSecondary omniscient is even more unusual, and typically occurs when the character is reflecting back on her life or has some sort of special power that causes omniscience.  The Coen Brothers used this POV in No Country for Old Men, with sheriff Bell reflecting back on a particular case.[20]\n\n"
