As part of a major revision of mantid taxonomy,[1] this family now contains the subfamily Tarachodinae, which includes tribes and genera previously placed in the now obsolete Tarachodidae.\n\nThe new placement means that this taxon is characteristic of the superfamily Eremiaphiloidea (of group Cernomantodea) and infraorder Schizomantodea.  Genera in this family have been recorded from: Africa and Asia.[2]\n\n"
