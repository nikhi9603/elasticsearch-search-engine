            "text": "Murugan is a Hindu denomination that primarily venerates the Hindu deity of war, Kumaran, also known as Murugan (in South India), Kandan, or Kadamban, or Kartikeya, aarumugan,  . Most devotees of Kumaran also revere members of his family: Parvati, Shiva, and Ganesha, as well his consorts, Devasena and Sundaravalli, the daughters of Vishnu in Tamil tradition.[1] The important theological texts relating to Kumara are a part of the Shaiva agama canon. This sub-tradition is found among the Tamils, Kannadigas, and the Vedda, in South India, Sri Lanka, and among the Tamil diaspora worldwide.[2] The love story of Kumara/Murugan and his wife Valli, a girl from a local tribe, is popular in Tamil Nadu, where Kumara acquired the status of a national god.[3][note 1]\n\n"
