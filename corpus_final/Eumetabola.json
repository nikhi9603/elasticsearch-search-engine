Two large unities known as the Paurometabola and Eumetabola are probably from the adelphotaxa of the Neoptera after exclusion of the Plecoptera. The monophyly of these unities appears to be weakly justified.[1]\n\nEumetabola has the highest number of species of any clade.[clarification needed] According to a phylogenetic analysis, the Eumetabola clade originated 390-350 million years ago, in the Late Devonian.[2]\n\n"
