            "text": "Axelrad earned bachelor's and master's degrees in aeronautical and astronautical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in 1985 and 1986 respectively.[1] At MIT, she was also captain of the university's fencing team.[2] She completed her Ph.D. at Stanford University in 1991,[1] working on the plans for Gravity Probe B[3] under the supervision of Bradford Parkinson.[4]\n\nAfter continuing at Stanford for a year as a lecturer, while working in industry at Stanford Telecommunications Corp., she moved to the University of Colorado in 1992 as an assistant professor. She was promoted to full professor in 2005 and chaired the department of aerospace engineering sciences from 2012 to 2017.[1] Axelrad is a member of the GPS Advisory Board[5] and of the NASA Advisory Council.[6] She served as president of the Institute of Navigation for 2004â€“2005.[3]\n\n"
