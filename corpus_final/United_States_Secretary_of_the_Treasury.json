The secretary is a statutory member of the Cabinet of the United States, and is fifth in the presidential line of succession.\n\nUnder the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution, the officeholder is nominated by the president of the United States, and, following a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Finance, is confirmed by the United States Senate.\n\nThe secretary of state, the secretary of the treasury, the secretary of defense, and the attorney general are generally regarded as the four most important Cabinet officials, due to the size and importance of their respective departments.[4]\n\nThe current secretary of the treasury is Janet Yellen, who is the first woman to hold the post.[5][6]\n\n"
