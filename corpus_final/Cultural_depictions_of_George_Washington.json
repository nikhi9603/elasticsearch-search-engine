The following lists cover various media to include items of historic interest, enduring works of high art, and recent representations in popular culture.  The entries represent portrayals that a reader has a reasonable chance of encountering rather than a complete catalog.  Lesser known works are not included.\n\nFor purposes of classification, popular culture music is a separate section from operas and oratorios.  Television covers live action series, TV movies, miniseries, and North American animation but not Japanese anime, which appears with manga and graphic novels.\n\n"
