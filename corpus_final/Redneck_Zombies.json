The film was once used as an answer in a 1980s edition of Trivial Pursuit, the question being \"What film has the tagline 'They're Tobacco Chewin', Gut Chompin', Cannibal Kinfolk from Hell!'\". Director Pericles Lewnes went on to work as a special effects supervisor on several other Troma productions.[1] William Benson (Pa) went on to become an Emmy-award winning director for NASA.\n\n"
