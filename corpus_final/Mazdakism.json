The religion has been called one of the most noteworthy examples of pre-modern communism.[1]\n\nThe religion was founded in the early Sasanian Empire by Zardusht, a Zoroastrian mobad who was a contemporary of Mani (d. 274).[2] However, it is named after its most prominent advocate, Mazdak, who was a powerful and controversial figure during the reign of Emperor Kavad I (r. 498–531).[3]\n\n"

Followers were to treat all people, even their enemies kindly. The movement also believed in the holding of all things in common to reduce greed[citation needed] and, allegedly,[4] promoted group marriage or polyandry, the latter if true presumably due to the lack of women for poor men to marry due to the polygyny of the upper classes of Iranian society at the time.[5]\n\n"
