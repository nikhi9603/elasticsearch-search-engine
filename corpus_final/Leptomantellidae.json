As part of a major revision of mantid taxonomy,[1] genera have been moved here from the Caliridinae in the now obsolete family Tarachodidae.\n\nThe new placement is in superfamily Nanomantoidea (of group Cernomantodea) and infraorder Schizomantodea.  Species in this family have been recorded from Asia, including India and Indochina.[2]\n\n"
