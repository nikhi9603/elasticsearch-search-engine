Future generations are contrasted with current and past generations, and evoked in order to encourage thinking about intergenerational equity.[1] The moral patienthood of future generations has been argued for extensively among philosophers, and is thought of as an important, neglected cause by the effective altruism community.[2] The term is often used in describing the conservation or preservation of cultural heritage or natural heritage.\n\nThe sustainability and climate movements have adopted the concept as a tool for enshrining principles of long-term thinking into law.[3] The concept is often connected to indigenous thinking as a principle for ecological action, such as the seven generation concept attributed to Iroquois tradition.[4]\n\n"

This concept is referred to in the most widely quoted definition of sustainability as a part of the concept sustainable development, is that of the Brundtland Commission of the United Nations on March 20, 1987: \"sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\"[5][6]\n\nThe use of future generations in international law is in part recognized by the Charter of the United Nations which focuses on preventing the \"scourge of war\" on future generations.[4] With the publication of UN Secretary-General's landmark Our Common Agenda report in September 2021,[7] there has been a renewed interest in understanding, action for, and representing future generations in the multilateral system.[8]\n\n"

In Wales, this moral obligation is encoded as a legal duty in the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 and in the role of the Future Generations Commissioner.[12] The first commissioner Sophie Howe modeled the role, proposing a number of new policies designed for future-thinking policy in Wales, including a 2020 Manifesto for the Future.[13] Similarly in Hungary the office of the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations was established in 2008.[14]\n\nThe rights of future generations are increasingly being protected in legal precedents as part of the global trends in climate litigation.[15] Future generations were the defendant in the critical defendants in a 2018 case Future Generations v. Ministry of the Environment and Others in Colombia which protected the Amazon rainforest basin for future generations.[15]\n\n"
