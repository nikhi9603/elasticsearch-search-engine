            "text": "Enceladus is a small icy moon, seemingly similar in chemical makeup to comets,[3] with jets or geysers of water erupting from its surface that might be connected to active hydrothermal vents at its subsurface water ocean floor,[4][5][6][7][8] where the moon's ocean meets the underlying rock, a prime habitat for life.[9][10] The geysers could provide easy access for sampling the moon's subsurface ocean, and if there is microbial life in it, ice particles from the sea could contain the evidence astrobiologists need to identify them.[11] An organic-rich world, Titan has a methane cycle comparable in atmospheric and geological processes to Earth's water cycle.\n\nThe JET orbiter mission concept was proposed in 2011 by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to NASA's Discovery Program Mission #13.[12] During the orbiter's one-year mission, it would perform high-resolution mass spectroscopy mapping that would determine what processes have shaped and are shaping the moons, and it would permit assessment of the habitability potential of Enceladus and Titan.[8][12]\n\nIn order to meet the $450 million cost cap, the orbiter would carry only two instruments. It would orbit Saturn and make a total of 16 flybys of Enceladus and  Titan, the closest ones at 900 km from Titan's surface.[12] In June 2015 NASA announced a list of five finalists for the current competition, but the Journey to Enceladus and Titan proposal was not selected. Lucy was selected on January 4, 2017 and is planned to launch in October 2021.[1][2]\n\n"
