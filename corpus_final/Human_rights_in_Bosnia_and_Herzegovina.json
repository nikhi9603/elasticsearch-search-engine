            "text": "The human rights record of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been criticised over a number of years by intergovernmental organisations including the United Nations Human Rights Council, the European Court of Human Rights and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, as well as international and domestic non-governmental organisations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been criticised for ethnic and religious discrimination in its treatment of ethnic and religious minorities such as the Romani people and the Jewish people.[1] The government has also been criticised for its treatment of Internally Displaced Persons following the Bosnian War and its failure to provide asylum seekers with resources such as food, shelter and medical assistance. According to BH Novinari, the Bosnian Journalists’ Association, freedom of the media is an issue in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with journalists facing attacks, threats and pressure from government. Human rights non-government organisations have also reported interference in their work from the government. The Bosnian government has been criticised by the European Union for its slow response to domestically prosecute war crimes from the Bosnian War following the closure of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in December 2017.\n\n"

            "text": "In 2019 the World Bank published a report that found that discrimination against the Roma people is a significant problem in Western Balkan countries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina. The report found that Roma people, who comprise 1.7% of the Bosnian population, have more difficulty accessing basic services such as healthcare, education, employment and housing than the non-Roma population.[5]\n\nInternational non-government organisation Human Rights Watch identified in its Annual Report for 2020 that discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities remains a significant human rights issue in Bosnia and Herzegovina.[1] The Bosnian constitution prohibits ethnic minorities such as the Jewish people and the Roma people, which are the two largest minority groups in the country, from running for presidency.[1]\n\nThe complexities of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina  are a result of the Dayton Peace Accords, which were signed in 1995 at the conclusion of the Bosnian War.[2]\n\nDue to the significant role that ethnic nationalism and ethnic identity politics play in Bosnian society, the Bosnian Constitution stipulates that the Presidency of the government must consist of three directly elected members.[2] One presidential member is elected each by the Bosniaks, the Croats and the Serbs.[2] A presidential candidate must identify with only one of these ethnic identities and is ineligible if they are a member of any additional ethnic groups, which prevents ethnic minorities, such as the Roma and Jewish people, from running for presidency, as well as anyone who belongs to more than one of the three main ethnic groups.[2] Additionally, Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs can only vote for one candidate who is of their own ethnic group.[2]\n\nThese ethnicity-based restrictions on eligibility to run for elected office are controversial, and have been criticised by international bodies such as the European Court of Human Rights.[1] In the 2009 case of Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Bosnian Constitution was discriminatory and a contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights.[6] Dervo Sejdić, a Roma man, and Jakob Finci, a Jewish man, lodged complaints to the European Court of Human Rights that they were ineligible to run for Presidency and the House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina due to their membership of ethnic minority groups, despite the fact that both men were Bosnian citizens.[6]\n\n"
