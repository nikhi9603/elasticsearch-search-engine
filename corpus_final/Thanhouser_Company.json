            "text": "Edwin Thanhouser constructed a studio in New Rochelle, New York. The company thrived under his leadership and by the summer of 1910, it had established itself as the best of the independents in the industry. Frank E. Woods of the American Biograph Company would pen an editorial in The New York Dramatic Mirror as \"The Spectator\", praising the Thanhouser company to this effect.[2][3]\n\nIt was sold to Mutual Film Corporation on April 15, 1912, for $250,000. Charles J. Hite took charge.\n\nOn January 13, 1913, a fire destroyed the main facility in New Rochelle; much equipment and many costumes and negatives of films in production were lost. However, subsidiary studios that had been set up were able to meet distributors' needs while it was being rebuilt.\n\nAfter Hite's death in an automobile accident, the company continued for another five years. After a period of floundering under inexperienced leadership, Edwin Thanhouser was hired to take charge, but he could not recreate the success of his earlier years. The film industry had evolved and was more competitive by this time, and although films featuring star Florence La Badie were still successful, other ventures were not. La Badie left Thanhouser Corporation in 1917, only weeks before her own death on October 13, 1917, due to injuries sustained in an automobile accident in late August. In 1920, Thanhouser Corporation was liquidated.[4]\n\n"

            "text": "The Thanhouser Company's first release was The Actor's Children on March 15, 1910.[5] The plot focused on a family of theater actors who struggle to pay the rent. While the parents are out, their kids are left out on the street where they dance to the music of an organ grinder. They are later rescued by a theater manager and are reunited with their parents at the theater. The film's conclusion is an example of the deus ex machina dramatic technique, which Lonergan used to conclude many scenarios.[6] Though it was the first release, it was not the first film to be produced; the first film produced was The Mad Hermit. Produced in the autumn of 1909, The Mad Hermit would not be released until August 1910.[7] According to Lloyd Lonergan, the first script he wrote was for Aunt Nancy Telegraphs, which was shot in December 1909 but never released.[8]\n\nThe next release would be an adaptation of Augusta Jane Evans's novel St. Elmo. The Thanhouser version of St. Elmo would bring the company some recognition and would prove to be a success, but the film is also presumed lost.[9] Thanhouser would release two more original scenarios, She's Done it Again and Daddy's Double,[10][11] before attempting two productions on the same reel. Released on April 15, 1910, A 29-Cent Robbery was included with The Old Shoe Came Back, a short comedy filler subject.[12][13] The main subject, A 29-Cent Robbery, was the debut of Marie Eline, soon to be famously known as the \"Thanhouser Kid\".[12] Two more split reels would follow before the release of Jane Eyre.[9] Productions adapted from novels included Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, Marie Corelli's Thelma and Mary Jane Holmes's Tempest and Sunshine.[14]\n\nMore adaptations of classic works, like Uncle Tom's Cabin, would be interspersed with several original scenarios like The Mermaid and The Restoration.[2] On August 9, The Mad Hermit was released and Edwin Thanhouser's fears of it being an amateur production were unfounded.[2][15] Films in the autumn included novel plots like Dots and Dashes, where Morse code facilitates a man's escape from a safe.[16] As Halloween approached, the company released The Fairies' Hallowe'en, a trick film geared towards child audiences.[17] A Thanksgiving Surprise would also be released in time for Thanksgiving.[18]\n\nThe winter of 1910 saw more adaptations of classics and short stories, including Paul and Virginia, John Halifax, Gentleman, Rip Van Winkle and The Vicar of Wakefield.[19] Love and Law was released on December 17, it was to be the first of four films in the \"Violet Gray, Detective\" series though it was originally billed as part of the \"Thanhouser Detective Series\".[20] Previously Thanhouser had released another film about a woman reporter who uncovered a political corruption in The Girl Reporter and a young woman who does the same in A Dainty Politician.[21][22] Thanhouser would also release Looking Forward, an adaptation of James Oliver Curwood's story, where a young chemist awakes a century later to a world run by women.[23] The last release of the year was Hypnotized, focusing on a traveling show with an ill-intentioned hypnotist.[24]\n\n"
