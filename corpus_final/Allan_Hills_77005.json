Initial geological examination determined that the meteorite was composed of ~55% olivine, ~35% pyroxene, ~8% maskelynite and ~2% opaques.[3]\n\nIn March 2019, researchers reported the possibility of biosignatures in this Martian meteorite based on its microtexture and morphology as detected with  optical microscopy and FTIR-ATR microscopy, and on the detection of mineralized organic compounds,[5][7][10] suggesting that microbial life could have existed on the planet Mars.[7] More broadly, and as a result of their studies, the researchers suggest Solar System materials should be carefully studied to determine whether there may be signs of microbial forms within other space rocks as well.[7]\n\n"
