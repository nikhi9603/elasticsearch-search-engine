It is a literary device of a narrative history all chronologically earlier than the narrative of primary interest. \n\nIn acting, it is the history of the character before the drama begins, and is created during the actor's preparation. \n\nIt is the history of characters and other elements  that underlie the situation existing at the main narrative's start. Even a purely historical work selectively reveals backstory to the audience.[1][2]\n\n"

            "text": "As a literary device, backstory is often employed to lend depth or believability to the main story. The usefulness of having a  dramatic revelation was recognized by Aristotle, in Poetics.\n\nBackstories are usually revealed, partially or in full, chronologically or otherwise, as the main narrative unfolds. However, a story creator may also create portions of a backstory or even an entire backstory that is solely for their own use.[3]\n\nBackstory may be revealed by various means, including flashbacks, dialogue, direct narration, summary, recollection, and exposition. The original  Star Wars film and its first two sequels are examples of a work with a preconceived backstory, which was later released as the \"prequel\" second set of three films.\n\n"

            "text": "Recollection is the fiction-writing mode whereby a character calls something to mind, or remembers it. A character's memory plays a role for conveying backstory, as it allows a fiction-writer to bring forth information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story. Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct fiction-writing mode, recollection is commonly used by authors of fiction.\n\nFor example, Orson Scott Card observes that \"If it's a memory the character could have called to mind at any point, having her think about it just in time to make a key decision may seem like an implausible coincidence . . . .\" Furthermore, \"If the memory is going to prompt a present decision, then the memory in turn must have been prompted by a recent event.\"[4]\n\n"
