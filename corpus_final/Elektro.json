            "text": "Elektro is the nickname of a robot built by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in its Mansfield, Ohio facility between 1937 and 1938.  Seven feet tall (2.1 m), weighing 265 pounds (120.2 kg), humanoid in appearance, he could walk by voice command, speak about 700 words (using a 78-rpm record player), smoke cigarettes, blow up balloons, and move his head and arms. Elektro's body consisted of a steel gear, cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin. His photoelectric \"eyes\" could distinguish red and green light. He was on exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair and reappeared at that fair in 1940, with \"Sparko\", a robot dog that could bark, sit, and beg to humans.\n\n"

            "text": "Elektro toured North America in 1950 in promotional appearances for Westinghouse, and was displayed at Pacific Ocean Park in Venice, California in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He also appeared as \"Thinko\", in Sex Kittens Go to College (1960). In the 1960s, his head was given to Harold Gorsuch, a retiring Westinghouse engineer.\n\nElektro and Sparko both appear as minor characters in the novel \"Mr. Atom\" (1969) by Theodore Pratt. The two join fellow machines in an attempt to go on strike and overthrow humans.[1]\n\nIn 1992, the dance band Meat Beat Manifesto produced the song \"Original Control (Version 2)\" which prominently featured snippets of Elektro's monologues, quoting lines such as \"I am Elektro\" and \"My brain is bigger than yours\".\n\nElektro is currently the property of the Mansfield Memorial Museum.[2][3] In 2013, a replica was exhibited at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI.[4]\n\nSparko’s fate is unknown.[5]\n\n"
