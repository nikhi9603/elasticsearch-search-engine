            "text": "Technology in science fiction is a crucial aspect of the genre.[1][2]\n\nAs science fiction emerged during the era of Industrial Revolution, the increased presence of machines in everyday life and their role in shaping of the society was a major influence on the genre.[1][2][3] It appeared as a major element of the Proto SF, represented by machines and gadgets in works of Jules Verne, George Griffith, H. G. Wells, Edward Bellamy and others.[1] Technology has been portrayed both in positive or negative ways; in some works it is a solution to the world problems, in others, a means of its destruction.[1][2] Such things as robots and space travel became commonplace in the fiction of the 19th century. \n\nConcepts and illustrations of technology in science fiction have been a significant influence in the formation of popular culture images of future technology.[1]\n\nScience fiction has often affected innovation and new technology â€“ for example many rocketry pioneers were inspired by science fiction.[4]\n\n"
