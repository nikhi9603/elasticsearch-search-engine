While films involving dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals are included on this list, those concerning legendary creatures, such as dragons or vampires, are not; however, films concerning anthropomorphised animals (such as Scooby-Doo), gigantized animals (such as King Kong), mutated forms of real animals (such as Anaconda), or fictional hybrids of real animals (such as Sharktopus) are considered to be films about animals, and are thus featured on this list.\n\n"
