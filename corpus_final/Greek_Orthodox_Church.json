The broader meaning designates \"the entire body of Orthodox (Chalcedonian) Christianity, sometimes also called 'Eastern Orthodox,' 'Greek Catholic,' or generally 'the Greek Church'\". The narrower meaning designates \"any of several independent churches within the worldwide communion of [Eastern] Orthodox Christianity that retain the use of the Greek language in formal ecclesiastical settings\".[1]\n\n"

            "text": "Historically, the term \"Greek Orthodox\" has been used to describe all Eastern Orthodox churches, since the term \"Greek\" can refer to the heritage of the Byzantine Empire.[2][3][4] During the first eight centuries of Christian history, most major intellectual, cultural, and social developments in the Christian Church took place in the Byzantine Empire or its sphere of influence,[4][5][6] where the Greek language was widely spoken and used for most theological writings. The empire's capital, Constantinople, was an early important center of Christianity, and its liturgical practices, traditions, and doctrines were gradually adopted throughout Eastern Orthodoxy, still providing the basic patterns of contemporary Orthodoxy.[7][8][9] Thus, Eastern Orthodox came to be called \"Greek\" Orthodox in the same way that Western Christians came to be called \"Roman\" Catholic. However, the appellation \"Greek\" was abandoned by the Slavic and other Eastern Orthodox churches as part of their peoples' national awakenings, beginning as early as the 10th century A.D.[10][11][12] Thus, by the early 21st century, generally only those churches most closely tied to Greek or Byzantine culture and ethnicity were called \"Greek Orthodox\" in common parlance.[13]\n\nGreek Orthodoxy has also been defined as a religious tradition rooted in preserving the Greek identity.[14]\n\n"
