As an undergraduate, he was a member of the Hasty Pudding.  He is remembered chiefly for his lenient treatment of students.  Kirkland House, one of Harvard's undergraduate \"houses,\" or residence halls, was named in his honor.\n\n"

            "text": "John and his twin brother, George, were born at Herkimer, New York, August 17, 1770. Their parents were Rev. Dr. Samuel Kirkland and his wife, Jerusha Bingham Kirkland.[1] She was a niece of Rev. Eleazar Wheelock, D. D.[2]\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes describes him thus, in his study of Ralph Waldo Emerson: \"His 'shining morning face' was round as a baby's, and talked as pleasantly as his voice did, with smiles for accents and dimples for punctuation.... It was of him that the story was always told,--it may be as old as the invention of printing,--that he threw his sermons into a barrel, where they went to pieces and got mixed up, and that when he was going to preach he fished out what he thought would be about enough for a sermon, and patched the leaves together as he best might.\"\n\nHis contemporary George Ticknor described Kirkland's sermons as \"full of intellectual wealth and practical wisdom, with sometimes a quaintness that bordered on humor.\"\n\nKirkland served as pastor of the New South Church in Boston, 1794–1810. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1799.[3]\nKirkland was a founding member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1812.[4]\nHis wife Elizabeth Cabot was the daughter of Congressman George Cabot.\n\n"
