            "text": "GEIPAN (an acronym for Groupe d'Études et d'Informations sur les Phénomènes Aérospatiaux Non-identifiés, or unidentified aerospace phenomenon research and information group). (/ɡaɪˈpɑːn/), its name since September 2005. (The group was formerly known as GEPAN[1] from 1977 to 1988, and SEPRA[2] from 1988 to 2004), is a unit of the French Space Agency CNES whose brief is to investigate unidentified aerospace phenomena (UAP),[3] and make its findings available to the public.\n\nThe French Gendarmerie was instructed to channel data from reports of UFO sightings to SEPRA, which therefore was in a position to draw on a large database of such events. In cases where physical traces appeared to be present, SEPRA could call on the technical resources of CNES to perform a thorough scientific investigation. A famous example of such an investigation was in the Trans-en-Provence Case.\n\nIn March 2007, GEIPAN started to make its archives available online to the public.\n\nFrench skeptics have criticized the quality of the work of the GEPAN.[4]\n\n"
