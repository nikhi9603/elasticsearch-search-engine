Joseph Needham notes that their works have been lost, except for the partially preserved  Gongsun Longzi, and the paradoxes of Chapter 33 of the Zhuangzi.[2] Needham considers the disappearance of the greater part of  Gongsun Longzi one of the worst losses in the ancient Chinese books, as what remains is said to reach the highest point of ancient Chinese philosophical writing.[1]\n\nOne of the few surviving lines from the school, \"a one-foot stick, every day take away half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted,\" resembles Zeno's paradoxes. However, some of their other aphorisms seem contradictory or unclear when taken out of context, for example, \"Dogs are not hounds.\"[3]\n\nThey were opposed by the Later Mohists for their paradoxes.[4]\n\n"
