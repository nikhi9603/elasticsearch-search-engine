The name was created by Westwood[1] and it has been revived as part of a major revision of mantid taxonomy;[2] the subfamily Iridopteryginae having been moved here from the obsolete family Iridopterygidae.  The Gonypetinae include Asian genera transferred from the obsolete taxa Amelinae and Liturgusidae.\n\nThe new placement is in superfamily Gonypetoidea (of group Cernomantodea) and infraorder Schizomantodea.  Genera in this family have been recorded from: NE Africa, the Middle East, India, Indochina, Malesia through to New Guinea.[3]\n\n"
