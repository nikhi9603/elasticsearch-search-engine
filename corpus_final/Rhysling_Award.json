            "text": "The Rhysling Awards are an annual award given for the best science fiction, fantasy, or horror poem of the year. Unlike most literary awards, which are named for the creator of the award, the subject of the award, or a noted member of the field, the Rhyslings are named for a character in a science fiction story: the blind poet Rhysling, in Robert A. Heinlein's short story \"The Green Hills of Earth\".[1] The award is given in two categories: \"Best Long Poem\", for works of 50 or more lines, and \"Best Short Poem\", for works of 49 or fewer lines.[1]\n\nThe nominees for each year's Rhysling Awards are chosen by the members of the Science Fiction Poetry Association (SFPA). Each member may nominate one work for each of the categories. The nominated works are then compiled into an anthology called The Rhysling Anthology, and members of the Association then vote on the final winners. From 2005 to 2011, the Awards were presented in July at a ceremony at Readercon. While the \"Best Short Poem\" category allows very short poems to be entered the SFPA also has the Dwarf Stars Award which is for poems from one to ten lines.[2]\n\nIn 2005, the SFPA published an anthology of the winning poems, The Alchemy of Stars: Rhysling Award Winners Showcase.[3][4]\n\n"
