            "text": "Mind control has proven a popular subject in fiction, featuring in books and films such as The Manchurian Candidate (1959; film adaptation 1962) and The IPCRESS File (1962; film 1965), both stories advancing the premise that controllers could hypnotize a person into murdering on command while retaining no memory of the killing. As a narrative device, mind control serves as a convenient means of introducing changes in the behavior of characters, and is used as a device for raising tension and audience uncertainty in the contexts of the Cold War and terrorism.  Mind control has often been an important theme in science fiction and fantasy stories.  Terry O'Brien comments:  \"Mind control is such a powerful image that if hypnotism did not exist,  then something similar would have to have been invented: the plot device is too useful for any writer to ignore.   The fear of mind control is equally as powerful an image.\"[1]\n\n"

            "text": "Hypnotism has often been used by stage performers to induce volunteers do strange things, such as clucking like a chicken, for the entertainment of audiences. The British psychological illusionist Derren Brown performs more sophisticated mental tricks in his television programmes, Derren Brown: Mind Control.\n\nThe late Russian psychic, Wolf Messing, was said to be able to hand somebody a blank piece of paper and make them see money or whatever he wanted them to see.\n\n"
