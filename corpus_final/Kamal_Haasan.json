The film was a commercial success and was dubbed in Hindi as Mirch Masala, which was never released.[46]\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus from Indian cinema, Haasan decided against reviving Marudhanayagam. He directed his second film, Hey Ram,[47] a period drama, told in flashback, with a fact-based plot centering on the partition of India and the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. Haasan produced and choreographed the film, writing its screenplay and lyrics; it was India's submission for the Academy Awards that year.[48] Hey Ram was a box-office failure in India but was successful worldwide.

Haasan's next film was 2001's Aalavandhan, in which he played two roles: For one he had his head shaved and gained ten kilograms. To play the other Army major in Aalavandhan, he went to the NDA for a crash course.[49] The Hindi version was distributed by Shringar Films.[50][51] Despite pre-release publicity, the film was a commercial failure.[52]\n\nAfter a number of successful comedies[53] including Pammal K. Sambandam and Panchatanthiram and guest appearances, Haasan directed Virumaandi, a film about capital punishment which won the Best Asian Film Award at the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival.[54] He also appeared in Anbe Sivam with Madhavan.

He then produced and starred in Unnaipol Oruvan, a remake of the Bollywood film A Wednesday, where he reprised the role originally played by Naseeruddin Shah with Malayalam actor Mohanlal playing Anupam Kher's role.[58][59] It was released in Telugu as Eeenadu, with Venkatesh reprising the role played by Kher.[60] Both versions were critically acclaimed and commercially successful.[60][61]\n\nHaasan collaborated for the fifth time with Ravikumar in Manmadan Ambu, for which he also wrote the screenplay. The story concerns a man who hires a detective to find out if his fiancée is cheating on him.[62] The film was released in December 2010 to mixed reviews, with Behindwoods calling it \"an entertainer, but in parts\"[63] and Sify saying it \"lacks the punch to captivate the audiences\".[64]\n\nHaasan's next film after Manmadhan Ambu was 2013's Vishwaroopam, released in Hindi as Vishwaroop. It won two National Film Awards (Best Production Design and Best Choreography) at the 60th National Film Awards.[65] Muslim groups in Tamil Nadu demanded the ban of the film and claimed, that the film would hurt Muslim sentiments.[66][67] Although the film was cleared by Central Board of Film Certification of India, district collectors in the state of Tamil Nadu gave orders to the theatre owners to not show Vishwaroopam, citing law and order problems. However, the film was released in other states with greater Muslim populations than in Tamil Nadu. A mutual agreement with the Muslims of Tamil Nadu was finally settled on 2 February 2013, when Haasan accepted to mute five scenes. Vishwaroopam was the highest-grossing Tamil film of 2013.[68]\n\nIn May 2014, he was appointed as the official Indian delegate to the 67th Cannes Film Festival.[69] As of July 2014, he was working on three films: Uttama Villain, Vishwaroopam II, the sequel of Vishwaroopam[70] and Papanasam.[71] After 2 years of Vishwaroopam's release, Uttama Villain was released on 2 May 2015 with exceptional critical reviews and on 3 July 2015, Papanasam a Tamil remake of Malayalam film Drishyam[72] was released with positive reviews and became a huge success[73] followed by the bi-lingual Thoongaa Vanam and Cheekati Rajyam,[74] both doing moderate business.\n\nHe was set to reprise his role of Balram Naidu (a Telugu RAW Officer) from Dasavathaaram in a spin-off film directed by himself titled Sabaash Naidu. The film was to be made in Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi (as  Shabhash Kundu). The film's release date has been delayed owing to Haasan's entry into politics, and he pledged that he focus on working on Indian 2 instead.[75]\n\nOn 17 September 2020, director Lokesh Kanagaraj announced through his Twitter handle that his next venture will have Kamal Haasan in lead role with Anirudh handling the music with the movie titled as Vikram. It was Kamal Hassan's 232nd film as an actor.[76] The film was released on 3 June 2022 and was a huge commercial success grossing ₹442.45 crore (US$55 million) and went on to become the highest-grossing Tamil film of the year and fourth highest-grossing Tamil film of all time by beating the collections made by other Tamil films like Beast, Valimai, Etharkkum Thunindhavan and Don etc.[77] The first single of Vikram titled \"Pathala Pathala\" received several million views from Kamal Haasan's fans and was the most viewed song on YouTube.[78] \nThe song also received praise for Kamal Haasan's dance performances which went viral. Despite facing controversies from the song, it became an instant hit.[79] In August 2022, the filming for Indian 2 resumed, after a break of almost an year. It is now scheduled for release in summer 2023. After Indian 2, he will be collaborating and reuniting with Mahesh Narayanan and Mani Ratnam respectively, for his 233rd and 234th films.[80][81][82]\n\nIn addition to acting, Haasan is noted for his involvement in other aspects of filmmaking.[41] He has written many of his films, including Raja Paarvai, Apoorva Sagodharargal, Michael Madana Kama Rajan, Thevar Magan, Mahanadhi, Hey Ram, Aalavandhan, Anbe Sivam, Nala Damayanthi, Virumaandi, Dasavathaaram, Manmadan Ambu and Vishwaroopam. Haasan's production company (Raaj Kamal Films International) has produced several of his films, and he directed Chachi 420, Hey Ram, Virumaandi and Vishwaroopam. He considered directing full-time if Hey Ram was successful, but changed his mind when the film failed at the box office.[83] In his earlier career, he choreographed for MGR in Naan Yen Pirandhen, Sivaji Ganesan in Savaale Samaali and Jayalalithaa in Anbu Thangai[84] In 2010 Haasan said he wanted to do more directing, since young actors wished to work for him. When he played supporting roles early in his career he wanted to become a technician and joked: \"Film makers like K. Balachander told me that I won't be able make much money by being a technician. So the end result is that the star Kamal funds the technician Kamal in pursuing his dreams\".[85] Haasan attended workshops for makeup technicians in the US for several years, and trained as a makeup artist under Michael Westmore.[86]\n\nHaasan has written songs for his films.

Srinivasan and Rajalakshmi, a housewife.[115] During 2013 his daughter Shruti Haasan appeared on an episode of Neengalum Vellalam Oru Kodi, where \"phone a friend\" option is availed to Shruti and when she called her father Kamal, he stated that his parents named him Parthasarathy before he was called as Kamal Haasan and his mother always used to call him by that name.[116] In an interview with Karan Thapar, Haasan said his father was literate in Sanskrit. Haasan was the youngest of four children; his siblings are Charuhasan, Chandrahasan and Nalini (Raghu). His two older brothers followed their father's example and studied law.[117] Haasan continued his education in Sir M.Ct. Muthiah Chettiar Boys Higher Secondary School[118] and Hindu Higher Secondary School in Madras (now Chennai).[citation needed]\n\nHaasan has alluded to his parents in some of his works, notably Unnaipol Oruvan and in the song \"Kallai Mattum\" in Dasavathaaram.[119] His oldest brother Charuhasan, like Haasan, is a National Film Award-winning actor who appeared in the Kannada film Tabarana Kathe. Charuhasan's daughter Suhasini is also a National Film Award winner married to director (and fellow award-winner) Mani Ratnam, who collaborated with Haasan on 1987's Nayakan.[120] Chandrahasan has produced several of Haasan's films and was an executive with Raaj Kamal Films International, he died in March 2017.[121] Chandrahasan's daughter Anu Hasan has had supporting roles in several films, including Suhasini's Indira. Haasan's sister, Nalini Raghu, is a dance teacher for whom he named an auditorium (Nalini Mahal).[122] Her son, Gautham, played Haasan's grandson in \"Hey Ram\".\n\nIn 1978, at age 24, Haasan married dancer Vani Ganapathy.[123] She acted with Haasan in the 1975 movie Melnaattu Marumagal. After marriage, Vani worked as Haasan's costume designer for several movies. They divorced ten years later.[citation needed]\n\nHaasan and actress Sarika began living together in 1988, marrying after the birth of their first child, Shruti (born 1986). Shruti is a singer and a Tollywood-Kollywood actress. Their younger daughter, Akshara (born 1991), was assistant director for 2013's Vishwaroopam and actress for 2019's Kadaram Kondan. Sarika stopped acting soon after their marriage, Sarika worked as Haasan's costume designer for the movie Hey Ram and won the National Film Award for Best Costume Designer.[124][125] In 2002, the couple filed for divorce, which became final in 2004.[126] After their divorce, Sarika acted in movies and TV serials, winning the National Film Award for Best Actress for the 2005 film Parzania.[citation needed]\n\nFrom 2005 until 2016, Haasan was in a relationship with actress Gautami,[citation needed], his frequent co-star during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Gautami had announced on her blog that she had ended her relationship with him[4] writing, \"It is heartbreaking for me to have to say today that I and Mr. Haasan are no longer together. After almost 13 years together, it has been one of the most devastating decisions that I have ever had to make in my life.\"[127]\n\nEarly in his career, he co-starred in several films with Srividya.

In a BBC interview with Karan Thapar, Haasan said that his last name derives from the Sanskrit word hasya, and although the Yaakob Hassan connection was publicised by the media it was only \"a story\".[117] Haasan is considered left-leaning or independent. Although he initially abstained from politics, he entered regional politics in Tamil Nadu in 2018.[132] He also said that his entering politics would result in his death within a year.[133]\n\n"
