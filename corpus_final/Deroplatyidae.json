As part of a major revision of mantis taxonomy,[1] the subfamily Deroplatyinae has been moved here from the previously-structured family Mantidae.\n\nThe new placement is in superfamily Mantoidea (of group Cernomantodea) and infraorder Schizomantodea.  Genera in this family have been recorded from: Africa, India, Indochina and Malesia.[2]\n\n"
