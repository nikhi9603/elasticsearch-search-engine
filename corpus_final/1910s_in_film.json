By 1912, major motion-picture companies had set up production near or in Los Angeles.[1] In the early 1900s, most motion picture patents were held by Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company in New Jersey, and filmmakers were often sued to stop their productions. To escape this, filmmakers began moving out west, where Edison's patents could not be enforced.[2] Also, the weather was ideal and there was quick access to various settings. Los Angeles became the capital of the film industry.[3]\n\nDuring the First World War the film industries of Europe were devastated, and Hollywood replaced the French and Italian firms as the most popular film makers in the world.\n\n"
