            "text": "The argument from poor design, also known as the dysteleological argument, is an argument against the assumption of the existence of a creator God, based on the reasoning that any omnipotent and  omnibenevolent deity or deities would not create (say) organisms with the perceived suboptimal designs that occur in nature.\n\nThe argument is structured as a basic modus ponens: if \"creation\" contains many defects, then design appears an implausible theory for the origin of earthly existence.  Proponents most commonly use the argument in a weaker way, however:  not with the aim of disproving the existence of God, but rather as a reductio ad absurdum of the well-known argument from design (which suggests that living things appear too well-designed to have originated by chance, and so an intelligent God or gods must have deliberately created them).\n\nAlthough the phrase \"argument from poor design\" has seen little use, this type of argument has been advanced many times using words and phrases such as \"poor design\", \"suboptimal design\", \"unintelligent design\" or \"dysteleology/dysteleological\". The nineteenth-century biologist Ernst Haeckel applied the term \"dysteleology\" to the implications of organs so rudimentary as to be useless to the life of an organism.[1]  In his 1868 book Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschichte (The History of Creation), Haeckel devoted most of a chapter to the argument, ending with the proposition (perhaps with tongue slightly in cheek) of \"a theory of the unsuitability of parts in organisms, as a counter-hypothesis to the old popular doctrine of the suitability of parts\".[1]  In 2005, Donald Wise of the University of Massachusetts Amherst popularised the term \"incompetent design\" (a play on \"intelligent design\"), to describe aspects of nature seen as flawed in design.[2]\n\nTraditional Christian theological responses generally posit that God constructed a perfect universe but that humanity's misuse of its free will to rebel against God has resulted in the corruption of divine good design.[3][4][5]\n\n"

This predicts that features that were evolved for certain uses are then reused or co-opted for different uses, or abandoned altogether; and that suboptimal state is due to the inability of the hereditary mechanism to eliminate the particular vestiges of the evolutionary process.\n\nIn fitness landscape terms, natural selection will always push \"up the hill\", but a species cannot normally get from a lower peak to a higher peak without first going through a valley.\n\nThe argument from poor design is one of the arguments that was used by Charles Darwin;[6] modern proponents have included Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins. They argue that such features can be explained as a consequence of the gradual, cumulative nature of the evolutionary process. Theistic evolutionists generally reject the argument from design, but do still maintain belief in the existence of God.[citation needed]\n\n"

            "text": "Intelligent design proponent William Dembski questions the first premise of the argument, claiming that \"intelligent design\" does not need to be optimal.[26]\n\nWhile the appendix has been previously credited with very little function, research has shown that it serves an important role in the fetus and young adults. Endocrine cells appear in the appendix of the human fetus at around the 11th week of development, which produce various biogenic amines and peptide hormones, compounds that assist with various biological control (homeostatic) mechanisms.  In young adults, the appendix has some immune functions.[27]\n\nIn response to the claim that uses have been found for \"junk\" DNA, proponents note that the fact that some non-coding DNA has a purpose does not establish that all non-coding DNA has a purpose, and that the human genome does include pseudogenes that are nonfunctional \"junk\", with others noting that some sections of DNA can be randomized, cut, or added to with no apparent effect on the organism in question.[28] The original study that suggested that the Makorin1-p1 served some purpose[29] has been disputed.[30] However, the original study is still frequently cited in newer studies and articles on pseudogenes previously thought to be nonfunctional.[31]\n\n"

            "text": "The argument from poor design is sometimes interpreted, by the argumenter or the listener, as an argument against the existence of God, or against characteristics commonly attributed to a creator deity, such as omnipotence, omniscience, or personality. In a weaker form, it is used as an argument for the incompetence of God. The existence of \"poor design\" (as well as the perceived prodigious \"wastefulness\" of the evolutionary process) would seem to imply a \"poor\" designer, or a \"blind\" designer, or no designer at all. In Gould's words, \"If God had designed a beautiful machine to reflect his wisdom and power, surely he would not have used a collection of parts generally fashioned for other purposes. Orchids are not made by an ideal engineer; they are jury-rigged....\"[32]\n\nThe apparently suboptimal design of organisms has also been used by theistic evolutionists to argue in favour of a creator deity who uses natural selection as a mechanism of his creation.[33] Arguers from poor design regard counter-arguments as a false dilemma, imposing that either a creator deity designed life on earth well or flaws in design indicate the life is not designed. This allows proponents of intelligent design to cherry pick which aspects of life constitute design, leading to the unfalsifiability of the theory. Christian proponents of both intelligent design and creationism may claim that good design indicates the creative intelligence of their God, while poor design indicates corruption of the world as a result of free will that caused the fall of man (for example, in Genesis 3:16 Yahweh says to Eve \"I will increase your trouble in pregnancy\").[34]\n\n"
