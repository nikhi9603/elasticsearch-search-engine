            "text": "The Hainish Cycle consists of a number of science fiction novels and stories by Ursula K. Le Guin. It is set in a future history in which civilizations of human beings on planets orbiting a number of nearby stars, including Terra (\"Earth\"), are contacting each other for the first time and establishing diplomatic relations, setting up a confederacy under the guidance of the oldest of the human worlds, peaceful Hain. In this history, human beings did not evolve on Earth but were the result of interstellar colonies planted by Hain long ago, which was followed by a long period when interstellar travel ceased. Some of the races have new genetic traits, a result of ancient Hainish experiments in genetic engineering, including people who can dream while awake, and a world of androgynous people who only come into active sexuality once a month, not knowing which sex will manifest in them. In keeping with Le Guin's style, she uses varied social and environmental settings to explore the anthropological and sociological outcomes of human evolution in those diverse environments.\n\nThe Hainish novels The Left Hand of Darkness (1969) and The Dispossessed (1974) have won literary awards, as have the novella The Word for World Is Forest (1972) and the short story \"The Day Before the Revolution\" (1974).\n\nLe Guin herself often discounted the idea of a \"Hainish Cycle\", writing on her website that \"The thing is, they aren't a cycle or a saga. They do not form a coherent history. There are some clear connections among them, yes, but also some extremely murky ones.\"[1][2]\n\n"

            "text": "In the first three novels—Rocannon's World (1966), Planet of Exile (1966), and City of Illusions (1967)—there is a League of All Worlds. By City of Illusions, the League seems to have been conquered or fragmented by an alien race, the Shing, from beyond the League.\n\nIn the fourth, The Left Hand of Darkness (1969), it seems that the planets of the former League have reunited as the Ekumen, which was founded by the Hainish people.\n\nIn the fifth, The Word for World Is Forest (1972), the League of All Worlds and the ansible are new creations, and the term \"Ekumen\" is not used; it is set before any of the first four books. Note that the 1972 publication was part of the anthology Again, Dangerous Visions.  It was only published as a separate book in 1976.\n\nThe sixth, The Dispossessed (1974), is the earliest novel chronologically in the Hainish Cycle. The Cetians have been visited by people from other planets, including Terra (Earth) and Hain. The various planets are separate, though there is some talk of a union. The idea of the ansible is known but none yet exists.\n\nLater novels and short stories speak only of the Ekumen—which now includes the Gethenians, who were the subject of The Left Hand of Darkness—and not of the League.\n\n"

            "text": "Hundreds of thousands of years ago, the people of Hain colonized a large number of worlds, including Earth, known as Terra. Most of these were similar enough that humans from one world can pass as natives of another, but on some the old Hainish 'colonisers' used genetic engineering. At least one of the various species of Rocannon's World are the product of genetic engineering, as are the \"hilfs\" (\"highly intelligent life forms\")[3] of Planet S[citation needed] (whose story has not so far been told), and probably the androgynous humans of Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness. The Ekumen do not know whether the colonisers sought to adapt humans to varied worlds, were conducting various experiments, or had other reasons.\n\nHainish civilization subsequently collapsed, and the colony planets (including Earth) forgot that other human worlds existed. The Ekumen stories tell of the efforts to re-establish a civilization on a galactic scale through NAFAL (Nearly As Fast As Light) interstellar travel taking years to travel between stars (although only weeks or months from the viewpoint of the traveler because of time dilation), and through instantaneous interstellar communication using the ansible.\n\nThis seems to have happened in two phases: First, the League of All Worlds was formed, as an alliance of planets, mostly descended from colonization efforts from the planet Hain, uniting the \"nine known worlds\"[4] — presumably along with new colonies. By the time of Rocannon's World it has grown but is also under threat from a distant enemy. In City of Illusions it is recalled as having been a league of some 80 worlds at the time it was destroyed by aliens called the Shing, who are uniquely able to lie in mindspeech. After the apparent overthrow of the Shing by Terran descendants from Alterra / Werel (capable of recognizing the Shing lies), the alliance is eventually reconstructed.\n\nA second phase begins with The Left Hand of Darkness. The 80 plus planets seem to have reunited as the Ekumen – a name derived from the Greek \"oikoumene\", meaning \"the inhabited world\", although characters occasionally refer to it as \"the Household\",[5] which is in turn a reference to the Greek \"oikos\", a word which developed from the same root as \"oikoumene\". Unexplained references are made by the protagonist from Terra in the Left Hand of Darkness to a long-past \"Age of the Enemy\", which presumably refers to the time that the Shing controlled Terra, portrayed in City of Illusions.\n\n"

            "text": "The Ekumen (or the League of All Worlds, though that is also believed to be the previous planetary coalition, before some sort of galactic crisis) contains a very large number of planets and is continually exploring new ones. Genly Ai in The Left Hand of Darkness explains that there are 83 planets in the Ekumen, with Gethen a candidate for becoming the 84th. The process of reaching out to potential civilizations is a tedious and sometimes dangerous one.\n\n"

            "text": "Societies tend to use sophisticated but unobtrusive technologies.  Most notable is the ansible, an instant-communication device that keeps worlds in touch with each other.\n\nPhysical communication is by NAFAL (Nearly As Fast As Light) ships.  The physics is never explained; the ship vanishes from where it was and reappears somewhere else many years later.[6] The trip takes slightly longer than it would to cross the same distance at the speed of light, but ship-time is just a few hours for those on board. It cannot be used for trips within a solar system.[5] Trips can begin or end close to a planet, but if used without a \"retemporalizer\", there are drastic physical effects at the end of long trips, at least according to the Shing, whose information may be suspect.[7]  It is also lethal if the traveler is pregnant.[8]\n\nCity of Illusions mentions automatic death-machines that work on the same principle as the ansible and can strike instantly at distant worlds. Such a device is clearly used in the events of Rocannon's World. The weapons are not mentioned again in later books.\n\nChurten theory, as developed by the physicists of Anarres, should allow people to go instantly from solar system to solar system. It is a development of the work of Shevek, whose tale is told in The Dispossessed.  Shevek's work made the ansible possible—it is mentioned in his tale that engineers decided they could build it once the correct theory was found. Churten theory offers a way to move people and spacecraft instantaneously, but there are side effects.  These are described in three short stories, \"The Shobies' Story,\" \"Dancing to Ganam\", and \"Another Story, or, A Fisherman of the Inland Sea,\" all collected in A Fisherman of the Inland Sea (1994).\n\nThe ansible has been adopted by other science fiction and fantasy authors, such as Orson Scott Card,[9] Elizabeth Moon,[10] and Vernor Vinge.[11]\n\n"

The Earth, called \"Terra\" in the Cycle, is mentioned as one of the failed civilizations.\n\n"
