            "text": "The principal function of melittin as a component of bee venom is to cause pain and destruction of tissue of intruders that threaten a beehive.  However, in honey bees, melittin is not only expressed in the venom gland, but also in other tissues when infected with pathogens. The two venom molecules, melittin and secapin, that are over-expressed in honey bees infected with various pathogens, possibly indicate a role for melittin in the immune response of bees to infectious diseases.[3]\n\n"

In water, it forms a tetramer but it also can spontaneously integrate itself into cell membranes.[4]\n\n"

            "title": "Mechanism of action",
            "text": "Injection of melittin into animals and humans causes pain sensation. It has strong surface effects on cell membranes causing pore-formation in epithelial cells and the destruction of red blood cells. Melittin also activates nociceptor (pain receptor) cells through a variety of mechanisms.[2]\n\nMelittin can open thermal nociceptor TRPV1 channels via cyclooxygenase metabolites resulting in depolarization of nociceptor cells.  The pore forming effects in cells causes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  It also activates G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated opening of transient receptor potential channels.  Finally melittin up-regulates the expression of Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 sodium channels in nociceptor cell causing long term action potential firing and pain sensation.[2]\n\nMelittin inhibits protein kinase C, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, myosin light chain kinase, and Na+/K+-ATPase (synaptosomal membrane). Mellitin blocks transport pumps such as the Na+-K+-ATPase and the H+-K+-ATPase.[2]\n\n"
