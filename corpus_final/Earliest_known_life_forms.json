Potential \"remains of life\" were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.[59] \"Putative filamentous microfossils\", possibly of methanogens and/or methanotrophs, that lived about 3.42-billion-year-old in \"a paleo-subseafloor hydrothermal vein system of the Barberton greenstone belt have been identified in South Africa.\"[1][60]\n\nFossilized microorganisms (microfossils) have been found in hydrothermal vent precipitates from an ancient sea-bed in the Nuvvuagittuq Belt of Quebec, Canada. These may be as old as 4.28 billion years, the oldest evidence of life on Earth, suggesting \"an almost instantaneous emergence of life\" after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago.[2][3][6][7] Some researchers even speculate that life may have started nearly 4.5 billion years ago.[4][5] According to biologist Stephen Blair Hedges, \"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ... then it could be common in the universe\".[63][64][65] The possibility that terrestrial life forms may have been seeded from outer space has been considered.[66][67] In January 2018, a study found that 4.5 billion-year-old meteorites found on Earth contained liquid water along with prebiotic complex organic substances that may be ingredients for life.[62][68]\n\nAs for life on land, in 2019 scientists reported the discovery of a fossilized fungus, named Ourasphaira giraldae, in the Canadian Arctic, that may have grown on land a billion years ago, well before plants are thought to have been living on land.[69][70][71] In July 2018, scientists reported that the earliest life on land may have been bacteria 3.22 billion years ago.[72] In May 2017, evidence of microbial life on land may have been found in 3.48 billion-year-old geyserite in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia.[73][74]\n\n"
