            "text": "Al-Biruni (973–1048), wrote detailed comparative studies on the anthropology of religions and cultures across the Mediterranean Basin (including the so-called  \"Middle East\") and the Indian subcontinent.[2] He discussed the peoples, customs, and religions of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nIn the 19th century cultural anthropology was dominated by an interest in cultural evolution; most anthropologists assumed a simple distinction between \"primitive\" and \"modern\" religion and tried to provide accounts of how the former evolved into the latter.[citation needed] In the 20th century most anthropologists rejected this approach.  Today the anthropology of religion reflects the influence of, or an engagement with, such theorists as Karl Marx (1818-1883), Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), Émile Durkheim (1858-1917), and Max Weber (1864-1920).[3] Anthropologists of religion are especially concerned with how religious beliefs and practices may reflect political or economic forces; or the social functions of religious beliefs and practices.[4][clarification needed]\n\nIn 1912 Émile Durkheim, building on the work of Feuerbach, considered religion \"a projection of the social values of society\", \"a means of making symbolic statements about society\", \"a symbolic language that makes statements about the social order\";[5] in short, \"religion is society worshiping itself\".[6][7][incomplete short citation]\n\nAnthropologists circa 1940 assumed that religion was in complete continuity with magical thinking,[a][8][dubious  – discuss]\nand that it is a cultural product.[b][9] The complete continuity between magic and religion has been a postulate of modern anthropology at least since early 1930s.[c][11] The perspective of modern anthropology towards religion is the projection idea, a methodological approach which assumes that every religion is created by the human community that worships it, that \"creative activity ascribed to God is projected from man\".[12] In 1841, Ludwig Feuerbach was the first to employ this concept as the basis for a systematic critique of religion.[13] A prominent precursor in the formulation of this projection principle was Giambattista Vico[14] (1668-1744), and an early formulation of it appears in the ancient Greek writer Xenophanes c. 570 – c. 475 BCE), who observed that \"the gods of Ethiopians were inevitably black with flat noses while those of the Thracians were blond with blue eyes.\"[15]\n\n"

            "text": "One major problem in the anthropology of religion is the definition of religion itself.[16] At one time[vague] anthropologists believed that certain religious practices and beliefs were more or less universal to all cultures at some point in their development, such as a belief in spirits or ghosts, the use of magic as a means of controlling the supernatural, the use of divination as a means of discovering occult knowledge, and the performance of rituals such as prayer and sacrifice as a means of influencing the outcome of various events through a supernatural agency, sometimes taking the form of shamanism or ancestor worship.[citation needed] According to Clifford Geertz, religion is\n\nToday, religious anthropologists debate, and reject, the cross-cultural validity of these categories (often viewing them as examples of European primitivism).[citation needed]  Anthropologists have considered various criteria for defining religion – such as a belief in the supernatural or the reliance on ritual – but few claim that these criteria are universally valid.[16]\n\nAnthony F. C. Wallace proposes four categories of religion, each subsequent category subsuming the previous. These are, however, synthetic categories and do not necessarily encompass all religions.[18]\n\n"
