Although chimneys never held the absolute height record, they are among the tallest free-standing architectural structures and often hold national records (as tallest free-standing or as overall tallest structure of a country).[citation needed]\n\nHamon Custodis claims to have built a 707-foot[14] 215.5 meter stack in 1953[22] but there are no references to the location or client of this/these stack(s). Skyscraperpage indicates the 846 ft 258 m Chimney of Omskaya Cogeneration Plant #4 was built in 1965[23] but it's likely that this date is referring to the construction of the first section of the plant with the smaller chimney. No other references or information can be found to corroborate this claim.\n\n"
