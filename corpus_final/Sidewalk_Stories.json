The black-and-white film tells the story of a young African American man raising a small child after her father is murdered. The film is somewhat reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin's 1921 feature The Kid. The film was televised by PBS as well as saw limited exposure on VHS and cable television in the 1990s.[1][2]\n\nIn October 2014, Sidewalk Stories was released on DVD and Blu-ray courtesy of Kino Lorber.[3]\n\n"
