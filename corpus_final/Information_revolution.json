            "text": "The term information revolution describes current economic, social and technological trends beyond the Industrial Revolution.\n\nMany competing terms have been proposed that focus on different aspects of this societal development.\nThe British polymath crystallographer J. D. Bernal  introduced the term \"scientific and technical revolution\" in his 1939 book The Social Function of Science to describe the new role that science and technology are coming to play within society. He asserted that science is becoming a \"productive force\", using the Marxist Theory of Productive Forces.[1] After some controversy, the term was taken up by authors and institutions of the then-Soviet Bloc. Their aim was to show that socialism was a safe home for the scientific and technical (\"technological\" for some authors) revolution, referred to by the acronym STR. The book Civilization at the Crossroads, edited by the Czech philosopher Radovan Richta (1969), became a standard reference for this topic.[2]\n\nDaniel Bell (1980) challenged this theory and advocated post-industrial society, which would lead to a service economy rather than socialism.[3] Many other authors presented their views, including Zbigniew Brzezinski (1976) with his \"Technetronic Society\".[4]\n\n"

            "text": "The main feature of the information revolution is the growing economic, social and technological role of information.[5] Information-related activities did not come up with the Information Revolution. They existed, in one form or the other, in all human societies, and eventually developed into institutions, such as the Platonic Academy, Aristotle's Peripatetic school in the Lyceum, the Musaeum and the Library of Alexandria, or the schools of Babylonian astronomy. The Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution came up when new informational inputs were produced by individual innovators, or by scientific and technical institutions. During the Information Revolution all these activities are experiencing continuous growth, while other information-oriented activities are emerging.\n\nInformation is the central theme of several new sciences, which emerged in the 1940s, including Shannon's (1949) Information Theory[6] and Wiener's (1948) Cybernetics. Wiener stated: \"information is information not matter or energy\". This aphorism suggests that information should be considered along with matter and energy as the third constituent part of the Universe; information is carried by matter or by energy.[7]  By the 1990s some writers believed that changes implied by the Information revolution will lead to not only a fiscal crisis for governments but also the disintegration of all \"large structures\".[8]\n\n"

            "text": "The term information revolution may relate to, or contrast with, such widely used terms as Industrial Revolution and Agricultural Revolution. Note, however, that you may prefer mentalist to materialist paradigm. The following fundamental aspects of the theory of information revolution can be given:[9][10]\n\nFrom a different perspective, Irving E. Fang (1997) identified six 'Information Revolutions': writing, printing, mass media, entertainment, the 'tool shed' (which we call 'home' now), and the information highway. In this work the term 'information revolution' is used in a narrow sense, to describe trends in communication media.[14]\n\n"

            "text": "Porat (1976) measured the information sector in the US using the input-output analysis; OECD has included statistics on the information sector in the economic reports of its member countries.[15] Veneris (1984, 1990) explored the theoretical, economic and regional aspects of the informational revolution and developed a systems dynamics simulation computer model.[9][10]\n\nThese works can be seen as following the path originated with the work of Fritz Machlup who in his (1962) book \"The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States\", claimed that the \"knowledge industry represented 29% of the US gross national product\", which he saw as evidence that the Information Age had begun. He defines knowledge as a commodity and attempts to measure the magnitude of the production and distribution of this commodity within a modern economy. Machlup divided information use into three classes: instrumental, intellectual, and pastime knowledge. He identified also five types of knowledge: practical knowledge; intellectual knowledge, that is, general culture and the satisfying of intellectual curiosity; pastime knowledge, that is, knowledge satisfying non-intellectual curiosity or the desire for light entertainment and emotional stimulation; spiritual or religious knowledge; unwanted knowledge, accidentally acquired and aimlessly retained.[16]\n\nMore recent estimates have reached the following results:[17]\n\n"
