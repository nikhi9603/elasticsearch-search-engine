            "text": "BionicKangaroo is a robot model developed and made by Festo in the form of a kangaroo.[1]  Applying methods from kinematics, bionics, and biomimetics, Festo's researchers and engineers studied the way kangaroos move, and applied that to the design of a robot that moves in a similar way.  The robot saves energy from each jump and applies it to its next jump, much as a real kangaroo does.[2]\n\n"
