Several of its principals were involved in the 100 Year Starship winning team originated by NASA and DARPA.[2]\n\n"

            "text": "Project Dragonfly:\n\ni4is has initiated a project working on small interstellar spacecraft, propelled by a laser sail in 2013 under the name of Project Dragonfly.[3][4] Four student teams worked on concepts for such a mission in 2014 and 2015 in the context of a design competition.[5][6][7][8][9] The design of the team from the University of California, Santa Barbara, has subsequently been selected as the baseline system architecture for Breakthrough Starshot. A subsequent study, Project Andromeda, has provided input to Breakthrough Starshot prior to its announcement in 2016.[10][11][12]\n\nProject Lyra:\nIn November 2017, i4is launched Project Lyra and proposed a set of mission concepts for reaching the interstellar objects 1I/Ê»Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and yet to be discovered objects.[13][14][15][16] The project has been featured in numerous media outlets.[17][18][19][20][21][22]\n\nWorld Ships:\n\ni4is has published on world ships, large interstellar generation ships and has presented its results at the ESA Interstellar Workshop in 2019 as well as in ESA's Acta Futura journal.[24][25][26]  Several of its core team members have previously worked on Icarus Interstellar's Project Hyperion.\n\nVenus astrobiology mission:\nSubsequent to the alleged discovery of phosphine in the Venusian atmosphere in 2020, i4is published a study on a dedicated astrobiology mission, based on a fleet of balloons to probe the Venusian atmosphere.[27][28]\n\nPrincipium:\nThe i4is publishes a quarterly newsletter, Principium.[29]\n\n"
