            "text": "\n\nBradley International Airport (IATA: BDL, ICAO: KBDL, FAA LID: BDL) is a public international airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, United States. Owned and operated by the Connecticut Airport Authority,[1] it is the second-largest airport in New England.[2]\n\nThe airport is about halfway between Hartford, Connecticut, and Springfield, Massachusetts. It is the state of Connecticut's busiest commercial airport and the second-busiest airport in New England after Boston's Logan International Airport, with over 6.75 million passengers in 2019.[3] The four largest carriers at Bradley International Airport are Southwest, Delta, JetBlue, and American with market shares of 29%, 19%, 15%, and 14%, respectively.[4] As a dual-use military facility with the U.S. Air Force, the airport is home to the 103d Airlift Wing (103 AW) of the Connecticut Air National Guard.\n\nBradley was originally branded as the \"Gateway to New England\" and is home to the New England Air Museum. In 2016, Bradley International launched its new brand, \"Love the Journey\".[5] In 2019, Bradley was the 55th-busiest commercial airport in the United States, by passengers enplaned.[6]\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a medium-hub primary commercial service facility.[7]\n\nThe former discount department store chain Bradlees was named after the airport as many of the early planning meetings were held there.[8]\n\n"

            "text": "Bradley has its origins in the 1940 acquisition of 1,700 acres (690 ha) of land in Windsor Locks by the state of Connecticut. In 1941, this land was turned over to the U.S. Army, as the country began its preparations for the impending war.[9]\n\nThe airfield was named after 24-year-old Lt. Eugene M. Bradley of Antlers, Oklahoma, assigned to the 64th Pursuit Squadron, who died when his P-40 crashed during a dogfight training drill on August 21, 1941.[10]\n\nThe airfield began civil use in 1947 as Bradley International Airport. Its first commercial flight was Eastern Air Lines Flight 624. International cargo operations at the airport also began that year. Bradley eventually replaced the older, smaller Hartford–Brainard Airport as Hartford's primary airport.[9]\n\nIn 1948, the federal government deeded the Airport to the State of Connecticut for public and commercial use.[9]\n\nIn 1950, Bradley International Airport exceeded the 100,000-passenger mark, handling 108,348 passengers.[9]\nIn 1952, the Murphy Terminal opened. Later dubbed Terminal B, it was the oldest passenger terminal of any major airport in the U.S. when it closed in 2010.[11]\n\nThe April 1957 OAG shows 39 weekday departures: 14 American, 14 Eastern, 9 United, and 2 Northeast. The first jets were United 720s to Cleveland in early 1961. Nonstops never reached west of Chicago or south of Washington until Eastern and Northeast began nonstops to Miami in 1967; nonstops to Los Angeles and Atlanta started in 1968.\n\nIn 1960, Bradley handled 500,238 passengers.[9]\n\nIn 1971, the Murphy Terminal was expanded with an International Arrivals wing. This was followed by the installation of instrument landing systems on two runways in 1977.\n\nIn 1974, construction began on an experimental People Mover to move people between the terminal and a parking lot 7/10 of a mile away.  It was completed in December 1975.  The People Mover consisted of a 7' wide roadway and two 30' long cars.[12][13]    It cost US$4.5 million to construct and was anticipated to cost $250,000 annually to operate. Due to the high operating cost and the fact that the parking lot it was connected to was not being used, the system was never put in service and was dismantled in 1984 to make room for a new terminal building.[14][15] The retired vehicles from the system are now on display at the Connecticut Trolley Museum in East Windsor, Connecticut.[16]\n\nIn 1979, the Windsor Locks tornado ripped through the eastern portions of the airport. The New England Air Museum sustained some of the worst damage. It reopened in 1981.[17]\n\nThe new Terminal A and Bradley Sheraton Hotel were completed in 1986. The Roncari cargo terminal was also built.[9]\n\n2001 saw the commencement of the Terminal Improvement Project to expand Terminal A with a new concourse, construct a new International Arrivals Building and centralize passenger screening. The airport expansion was part of a larger project to enhance the reputation of the Hartford metropolitan area as a destination for business and vacation travel. The new East Concourse, designed by HNTB, opened in September 2002.[9]\n\nIn December 2002 a new International Arrivals Building opened west of Terminal B,[9] housing the Federal Inspection Station with one jetway.[18] Two government agencies support the facility; U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The FIS Terminal can process more than 300 passengers per hour from aircraft as large as a Boeing 747. This facility cost approximately $7.7 million, which included the building and site work, funded through the Bradley Improvement Fund. Currently the International Arrivals Building is utilized by Delta Air Lines and Frontier Airlines (Apple Vacations) for their seasonal service to Cancun, Mexico and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.[19] All international arrivals except for those from airports with customs preclearance are processed through the IAB. International departures are handled from the existing terminal complex.\n\nNorthwest Airlines launched Hartford's first direct flight to Europe in July 2007, employing Boeing 757s on a route to Amsterdam.[20] Three months later, the Airbus A380 visited Bradley on its world tour, stopping in Hartford to showcase the aircraft to Connecticut workers for Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Sundstrand, both divisions of United Technologies, which helped build the GP7000 TurboFan engines, which is an option to power the aircraft. Bradley Airport is one of only 68 airports worldwide large enough to accommodate the A380. No carriers provide regular A380 service to Bradley, but the airport occasionally is a diversion airfield for JFK-bound A380s.[21]\n\nNorthwest Airlines terminated its service to Holland in October 2008, attributing its decision to the increased cost of jet fuel.[22] In the same month, Embraer, an aerospace company based in Brazil, selected Bradley as its service center for the Northeastern United States. An $11 million project was begun with support from teams of the Connecticut Department of Transportation and Connecticut's Economic and Community Development. The center is intended to be a full maintenance and repair facility for its line of business jets and is expected to employ up to 60 aircraft technicians. The facility was temporarily closed ten months after opening due to economic conditions, reopening on February 28, 2011.[23][24]\n\nOn June 22, 2012 the Connecticut Airport Authority board approved the hiring of Kevin A. Dillon as the Executive Director for the Connecticut Airport Authority, including Bradley International Airport.[25]\n\nOn October 21, 2015 Bradley announced renewed transatlantic service, partnering with Aer Lingus to bring daily flights between Bradley and Dublin.[26][27] Service to Dublin began on September 28, 2016. On September 13, 2018 Governor Dannel P. Malloy announced that Aer Lingus service at Bradley International Airport will continue for at least four more years under a new agreement made with the state, committing the airline to continue its transatlantic service at the airport through September 2022. Aer Lingus committed to placing one of its first four A321LR aircraft on the Bradley to Dublin route, replacing the  Boeing 757-200 assigned to the route. The flight was suspended for the Covid-19 Pandemic and was not immediately resumed.[28]\n\nNorwegian Air Shuttle flew the airport's third transatlantic European flight. The first flight was on June 17, 2017 to Edinburgh in the UK. On January 15, 2018 the airline announced it would end service from Bradley to Scotland, with the last flight leaving March 25, 2018.[29]\n\nOn January 25, 2017 Spirit Airlines announced new daily nonstop service to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale along with 4 times weekly seasonal service to Myrtle Beach. The first flight to Orlando was on April 27,[30] and service to Fort Lauderdale started on June 16.[31] The same day,[31] the company also announced seasonal nonstop service to Fort Myers and Tampa, which began on November 9, 2017.[32][33]\n\nOn January 25, 2021, Sun Country Airlines announced new service to Bradley International Airport beginning in May with nonstop service twice weekly to MSP Airport and in September 2021, service to Orlando.\n\nOn May 21, 2021, Breeze Airways announced new service to Bradley International Airport beginning May 27, 2021 with nonstop service to Charleston (SC), with service to Columbus-Glenn, Norfolk and Pittsburgh to begin in July. It also made BDL part of the first flights for the airline, with the first flight from Tampa to Charleston and continuing on to Hartford.\n\nOn February 17, 2022, Breeze Airways announced they would be establishing an operating base at Bradley International Airport. The announcement included the airline would begin service to an additional eight nonstop destinations from Bradley and create more than 200 new jobs.[34] On March 8, 2022 they announced service to six new destinations, Akron/Canton, Jacksonville, Nashville, Richmond, Sarasota/Bradenton and Savannah all beginning in June 2022.\n\n"
