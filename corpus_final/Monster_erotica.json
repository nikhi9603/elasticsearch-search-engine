            "text": "Scholars have identified erotic elements in horror novels featuring monstrous characters as far back as Carmilla (1872) by Sheridan Le Fanu and Dracula (1897) by Bram Stoker.[5][6] Science fiction films sometimes dealt with monsters and sexuality, as in I Married a Monster From Outer Space (1958).[7] As a distinct genre, however, monster erotica is a more recent development that found its audience on the internet after 2010. Most erotic monster novels are self-published. In 2013, none of the publishers contacted by Business Insider for an article about the genre responded when asked if they had been offered such works.[1]\n\nThe monster erotica genre attracted public attention in the 2010s on account of the surprising popularity such novels obtained in English-language e-book stores. Following a series of media reports in the United Kingdom in 2013 about the easy availability of self-published e-books with depictions of rape, incest and bestiality, leading e-book retailers such as Amazon.com removed a great number of self-published erotica from their websites, including many erotic monster novels.[1]\n\nThe genre again drew public attention when Denver Riggleman was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in Virginia's 5th congressional district in 2018. His opponent accused him of being a \"devotee of Bigfoot erotica\", which he denied.[8][9]\n\n"
