            "text": "\n\nFundamentalism is a tendency among certain groups and individuals that is characterized by the application of a strict literal interpretation to scriptures, dogmas, or ideologies, along with a strong belief in the importance of distinguishing one's ingroup and outgroup,[1][2][3][4]\nwhich leads to an emphasis on some conception of \"purity\", and a desire to return to a previous ideal from which advocates believe members have strayed. The term is usually used in the context of religion to indicate an unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs (the \"fundamentals\").[5]\n\nThe term \"fundamentalism\" is generally regarded by scholars of religion as referring to a largely modern religious phenomenon which, while itself a reinterpretation of religion as defined by the parameters of modernism, reifies religion in reaction against modernist, liberal and ecumenical tendencies developing in religion and society in general that it perceives to be foreign to a particular religious tradition. Depending upon the context, the label \"fundamentalism\" can be a pejorative rather than a neutral characterization, similar to the ways that calling political perspectives \"right-wing\" or \"left-wing\" can have negative connotations.[6][7]\n\n"

            "text": "Buddhist fundamentalism has targeted other religious and ethnic groups, as in Myanmar. A Buddhist-dominated country, Myanmar has seen tensions between Muslim minorities and the Buddhist majority, especially during the 2013 Burma anti-Muslim riots (possibly instigated by hardline groups such as the 969 Movement).[8] as well as during actions which are associated with the Rohingya genocide (2016 onwards).\n\nBuddhist fundamentalism also features in Sri Lanka. Buddhist-dominated Sri Lanka has seen recent tensions between Muslim minorities and the Buddhist majority, especially during the 2014 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka[9] and in the course of the 2018 anti-Muslim riots in Sri Lanka,[10] allegedly instigated by hardline groups such as the Bodu Bala Sena.[citation needed]\n\nHistoric and contemporary examples of Buddhist fundamentalism occur in each of the three main branches of Buddhism: Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. In addition to the above examples of fundamentalism in Theravada-dominated societies, the reification of a minor protector deity, Dorje Shugden, by 19th-century Tibetan lama Pabongkhapa could be seen as an example of fundamentalism in the Vajrayana tradition. Dorje Shugden was a key tool in Pabongkhapa's persecution of the flourishing Rimé movement, an ecumenical movement which fused the teachings of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma,[11] in response to the dominance of the Gelug school. Non-Gelug, especially Nyingma, monasteries were forced to convert to the Gelug position. Pabongkhapa feared a decline of Gelug monasteries, and induced a revival movement, which promoted the Gelug as the only pure tradition. He regarded the practice of non-Gelug teachings by Gelug monks as a threat to the Gelug tradition, and opposed the influence of the other schools, especially the Nyingma.[12] He coupled Dorje Shugden to Gelug exclusivism, using it against other traditions, and against Gelugpas with eclectic tendencies.[13] The main function of the deity was presented as \"the protection of the Ge-luk tradition through violent means, even including the killing of its enemies.\"[12]\n\nIn Japan, a prominent example has been the practice among some members of the Mahayana Nichiren sect of shakubuku – a method of proselytizing which involves the strident condemnation of other sects as deficient or evil.\n\nGeorge Marsden has defined Christian fundamentalism as the demand for strict adherence to certain theological doctrines, in opposition to Modernist theology.[14] Its supporters originally coined the term in order to describe what they claimed were five specific classic theological beliefs of Christianity, and the coinage of the term led to the development of a Christian fundamentalist movement within the Protestant community of the United States in the early part of the 20th century.[15] Fundamentalism as a movement arose in the United States, starting among conservative Presbyterian theologians at Princeton Theological Seminary in the late 19th century. It soon spread to conservatives among the Baptists and other denominations around 1910 to 1920. The movement's purpose was to reaffirm key theological tenets and defend them against the challenges of liberal theology and higher criticism.[16]\n\nThe concept of \"fundamentalism\" has roots in the Niagara Bible Conferences which were held annually between 1878 and 1897. During those conferences, the tenets widely considered to be fundamental Christian belief were identified.\n\n\"Fundamentalism\" was prefigured by The Fundamentals: A Testimony To The Truth, a collection of twelve pamphlets published between 1910 and 1915 by brothers Milton and Lyman Stewart. It is widely considered to be the foundation of modern Christian fundamentalism.\n\nIn 1910, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church identified what became known as the five fundamentals:[17]\n\nIn 1920, the word \"fundamentalist\" was first used in print by Curtis Lee Laws, editor of The Watchman Examiner, a Baptist newspaper.[18] Laws proposed that those Christians who were fighting for the fundamentals of the faith should be called \"fundamentalists\".[19]\n\nTheological conservatives who rallied around the five fundamentals came to be known as \"fundamentalists\". They rejected the existence of commonalities with theologically related religious traditions, such as the grouping of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism into one Abrahamic family of religions.[2] By contrast, while Evangelical groups (such as the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association) typically agree with the \"fundamentals\" as they are expressed in The Fundamentals, they are often willing to participate in events with religious groups that do not hold to the \"essential\" doctrines.[20]\n\nThe existence of fundamentalism in Hinduism is a complex and contradictory phenomenon. While some would argue that certain aspects of Gaudiya Vaishnavism manifest fundamentalist tendencies, these tendencies are more clearly displayed in Hindutva, the predominant form of Hindu nationalism in India today, and an increasingly powerful and influential voice within the religion. Hinduism includes a diversity of ideas on spirituality and traditions, but has no ecclesiastical order, no unquestionable religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, panentheistic, pandeistic, henotheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic or humanist.[21][22][23] According to Doniger, \"ideas about all the major issues of faith and lifestyle – vegetarianism, nonviolence, belief in rebirth, even caste – are subjects of debate, not dogma.\"[24]\n\nSome would argue that, because of the wide range of traditions and ideas covered by the term Hinduism, a lack of theological 'fundamentals' means that a dogmatic 'religious fundamentalism' per se is hard to find.[25] Others point to the recent rise of Hindu nationalism in India as evidence to the contrary. The religion \"defies our desire to define and categorize it.\" In India, the term “dharma” is preferred, which is broader than the Western term “religion.”[26]\n\nHence, certain scholars argue that Hinduism lacks dogma and thus a specific notion of \"fundamentalism,\" while other scholars identify several politically active Hindu movements as part of a \"Hindu fundamentalist family.\"[27][28]\n\nFundamentalism within Islam goes back to the early history of Islam in the 7th century, to the time of the Kharijites.[29] From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Shia and Sunni Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to takfir, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.[29][30][31][32]\n\nThe Shia and Sunni religious conflicts since the 7th century created an opening for radical ideologues, such as Ali Shariati (1933–77), to merge social revolution with Islamic fundamentalism, as exemplified by the Iranian Revolution in 1979.[33] Islamic fundamentalism has appeared in many countries;[34] the Salafi-Wahhabi version is promoted worldwide and financed by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Pakistan.[35][36][37][38][39][40]\n\nThe Iran hostage crisis of 1979–80 marked a major turning point in the use of the term \"fundamentalism\". The media, in an attempt to explain the ideology of Ayatollah Khomeini and the Iranian Revolution to a Western audience described it as a \"fundamentalist version of Islam\" by way of analogy to the Christian fundamentalist movement in the U.S. Thus was born the term Islamic fundamentalist, which became a common use of the term in following years.[41]\n\nJewish fundamentalism has been used to characterize militant religious Zionism, and both Ashkenazi and Sephardic versions of Haredi Judaism.[42] Ian S Lustik has characterized Jewish fundamentalism as \"an ultranationalist, eschatologically based, irredentist ideology.\"[43]\n\n"

            "text": "Political usage of the term \"fundamentalism\" has been criticized. It has been used by political groups to berate opponents, using the term flexibly depending on their political interests. According to Judith Nagata, a professor of Asia Research Institute in the National University of Singapore, \"The Afghan mujahiddin, locked in combat with the Soviet enemy in the 1980s, could be praised as 'freedom fighters' by their American backers at the time, while the present Taliban, viewed, among other things, as protectors of American enemy Osama bin Laden, are unequivocally 'fundamentalist'.\"[44]\n\n\"Fundamentalist\" has been used pejoratively to refer to philosophies perceived as literal-minded or carrying a pretense of being the sole source of objective truth, regardless of whether it is usually called a religion. For instance, the Archbishop of Wales has criticized \"atheistic fundamentalism\" broadly[45][46][47] and said \"Any kind of fundamentalism, be it Biblical, atheistic or Islamic, is dangerous\".[48] He also said, \"the new fundamentalism of our age ... leads to the language of expulsion and exclusivity, of extremism and polarisation, and the claim that, because God is on our side, he is not on yours.\"[49] He claimed it led to situations such as councils calling Christmas \"Winterval\", schools refusing to put on nativity plays and crosses being removed from chapels.  Others have countered that some of these attacks on Christmas are urban legends, not all schools do nativity plays because they choose to perform other traditional plays like A Christmas Carol or \"The Snow Queen\" and, because of rising tensions between various religions, opening up public spaces to alternate displays rather than the Nativity scene is an attempt to keep government religion-neutral.[50]\n\nIn The New Inquisition, Robert Anton Wilson lampoons the members of skeptical organizations such as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal as fundamentalist materialists, alleging that they dogmatically dismiss any evidence that conflicts with materialism as hallucination or fraud.[51]\n\nIn France, during a protestation march against the imposition of restrictions on the wearing of headscarves in state-run schools, a banner labeled the ban as \"secular fundamentalism\".[52][53] In the United States, private or cultural intolerance of women wearing the hijab (Islamic headcovering) and political activism by Muslims also has been labeled \"secular fundamentalism\".[54]\n\nThe term \"fundamentalism\" is sometimes applied to signify a counter-cultural fidelity to a principle or set of principles, as in the pejorative term \"market fundamentalism\", used to imply exaggerated religious-like faith in the ability of unfettered laissez-faire or free-market capitalist economic views or policies to solve economic and social problems. According to economist John Quiggin, the standard features of \"economic fundamentalist rhetoric\" are \"dogmatic\" assertions and the claim that anyone who holds contrary views is not a real economist. Retired professor in religious studies Roderick Hindery lists positive qualities attributed to political, economic, or other forms of cultural fundamentalism, including \"vitality, enthusiasm, willingness to back up words with actions, and the avoidance of facile compromise\" as well as negative aspects such as psychological attitudes,[which?] occasionally elitist and pessimistic perspectives, and in some cases literalism.[55]\n\n"

Rather, a fundamentalist's fundamentalism is their primary concern, over and above other denominational or faith considerations.[62]\n\n"
