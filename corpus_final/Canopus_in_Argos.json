            "text": "\n\nCanopus in Argos: Archives is a sequence of five science fiction novels by Nobel laureate author Doris Lessing, which portray a number of societies at different stages of development, over a great period of time. The focus is on accelerated evolution guided by advanced species for less advanced species and societies.\n\nThe novels all take place in the same future history, but do not form a continuous storyline. Each book covers unrelated events, with the exception of Shikasta and The Sirian Experiments, which tell the story of accelerated evolution on Earth through the eyes of Canopeans and Sirians, respectively.\n\n"

This set of writings represented a major shift of focus for Lessing, influenced by spiritual and mystical themes in Sufism, in particular by Idries Shah.[2] She later wrote several essays on Sufism which were published in her essay collection, Time Bites (2004).[3]\n\n"

They told her, \"Oh, realism, I can't be bothered with that.\"[7]\n\n"
