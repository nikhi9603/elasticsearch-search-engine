            "text": "The Shergotty meteorite (Named after Sherghati) is the first example of the shergottite Martian meteorite family. It was a 5-kilogram (11Â lb) meteorite which fell to Earth at Sherghati, in the Gaya district, Bihar, India on 25 August 1865, and was retrieved by witnesses almost immediately.[1] Radiometric dating indicates that it solidified from a volcanic magma about 4.1 billion years ago.[2] It is composed mostly of pyroxene and is thought to have undergone preterrestrial aqueous alteration for several centuries. Certain features within its interior are suggestive of being remnants of biofilm and their associated microbial communities.[3]\n\n"
