            "text": "\"At the Moving Picture Ball\" is a popular song composed by Joseph H. Santly[1][2] (né Joseph Harry Santly; 1886–1962) and recorded by many artists during the silent film era. Today the song is best remembered for its unusually topical lyrics, which mention many celebrities of the time. In fact, by 1920, the lyrics of the song had already been changed, since several celebrities mentioned had lost popularity. Judy Garland and Donald O'Connor performed the song on the 1963 TV series, The Judy Garland Show, during a \"tribute to vaudeville\" medley.\n\n"
