            "text": "The term \"sci-fi\" was suggested as an abbreviated term for \"science fiction\" by Forrest (\"Forry\") J Ackerman in 1954, an analogy to the then-cutting edge term \"hi-fi\" (for  audio high fidelity). Ackerman was a long-time fan, and at the time was the literary agent for science fiction authors Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, A.E. Van Vogt, Curt Siodmak and L. Ron Hubbard.[1] Ackerman pronounced his new term as /ˈsaɪˌfaɪ/ or \"sigh figh\". In the 1970s, some members of science fiction fandom began to pronounce the term /ˈskɪfi/ or \"skiffy\" for unclear reasons.\n\nPeter Nicholls writes that \"SF\" (or \"sf\") is \"the preferred abbreviation within the community of sf writers and readers.\"[2] David Langford's monthly fanzine Ansible includes a regular section \"As Others See Us\" which offers numerous examples of \"sci-fi\" and \"skiffy\" being used in a pejorative sense by people outside the genre.\n\nSkiffy is the name of the science fiction and fantasy club at the College of William and Mary,[3] and VCU,[4] as well as not always affectionate shorthand for the American cable channel once named The Sci-Fi Channel.\n\nIn 1998, Mike Resnick and Patrick Nielsen Hayden released a book called Alternate Skiffy,.[5] In keeping with the tongue-in-cheek intent of the term, this was an anthology featuring stories about what might have happened if the lives of various well-known science fiction writers had turned out differently.\n\n"
