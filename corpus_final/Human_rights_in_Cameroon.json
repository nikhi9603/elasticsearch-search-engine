He described the use of torture in Cameroon as 'widespread and systematic.'\"[2]\n\nIn its 2012 Annual Review, Freedom from Torture stated that they had received 33 referrals for torture survivors from Cameroon for clinical treatment or other services.\n\nAmnesty International reported concerns about violence by security forces. In 2009, around 100 civilians were killed during demonstrations.[3]\n\nIn April 2010, Germain Cyrille Ngota Ngota, the editor of the Cameroun Express, died in custody at Kondengui Central Prison.[4] He had been jailed pending trial in February 2010 along with the editors of two other newspapers, for the alleged \"joint forgery\" of the signature of a presidential official. One of the editors said that the document in question had merely been attached to an interview request, whilst the journalist who had originated the document was on the run.[5] \"The Federation of African Journalists after visiting the country described Cameroon in May 2010 as 'one of the worst jailers of journalists in Africa'.\"[4][6]\n\nAs of 2020, Cameroon \"currently prosecutes consensual same sex conduct more aggressively than almost any country in the world\".[7]\n\nOn 27 June 2022, the Human Rights Watch reported that the armed separatist fighters killed and injured people, raped a girl, and committed other grave human rights abuses across Cameroonâ€™s Anglophone regions. The separatists also burned schools, attacked universities, and kidnapped up to 82 people, with no apparent fear of being held to account by either their own leaders or Cameroonian law enforcement.[8]\n\n"
