Environmentalism is a social and environmental movement that addresses environmental issues through advocacy, legislation education, and activism.[2]\n\nEnvironment destruction caused by humans is a global, ongoing problem. Water pollution also cause problems to marine life. Most scholars think that the project peak global world population of between 9-10 billion people, could live sustainably within the earth's ecosystems if human society worked to live sustainably within planetary boundaries.[3][4][5] The bulk of environmental impacts are caused by the most wealthy populations in the globe consuming too much industrial goods.[6][7][8] The UN Environmental Program, in its \"Making Peace With Nature\" Report in 2021, found addressing key planetary crises, like pollution, climate change and biodiversity loss, was achievable if parties work to address the Sustainable Development Goals.[9]\n\n"

Governments enact environmental policy and enforce environmental law and this is done to differing degrees around the world.\n\n"
