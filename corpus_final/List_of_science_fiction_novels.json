            "text": "\nThis is a list of science-fiction novels, novel series, and collections of linked short stories. It includes modern novels, as well as novels written before the term \"science fiction\" was in common use. This list includes novels not marketed as SF but still considered to be substantially science fiction in content by some critics, such as Nineteen Eighty-Four. As such, it is an inclusive list, not an exclusive list based on other factors such as level of notability or literary quality. Books are listed in alphabetical order by title, ignoring the leading articles \"A\", \"An\", and \"The\". Novel series are alphabetical by author-designated name or, if there is none, the title of the first novel in the series or some other reasonable designation.\n\n"
