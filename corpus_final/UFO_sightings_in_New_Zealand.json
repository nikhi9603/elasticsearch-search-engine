The New Zealand Defence Force does not take an official interest in UFO reports,[1] but in December 2010  it released  files on hundreds of purported UFO reports.[2] New Zealand's then-Minister of Defence, Wayne Mapp said at the time people could \"make what they will\" of the reports, and said \"a quick scan of the files indicates that virtually everything has a natural explanation\".\n\n"
