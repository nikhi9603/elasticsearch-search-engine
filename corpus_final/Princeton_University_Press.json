            "text": "Princeton University Press was founded in 1905 by a recent Princeton graduate, Whitney Darrow, with financial support from another Princetonian, Charles Scribner II. Darrow and Scribner purchased the equipment and assumed the operations of two already existing local publishers, that of the Princeton Alumni Weekly and the Princeton Press. The new press printed both local newspapers, university documents, The Daily Princetonian, and later added book publishing to its activities.[5] Beginning as a small, for-profit printer, Princeton University Press was reincorporated as a nonprofit in 1910.[6] Since 1911, the press has been headquartered in a purpose-built gothic-style building designed by Ernest Flagg. The design of pressâ€™s building, which was named the Scribner Building in 1965, was inspired by the Plantin-Moretus Museum, a printing museum in Antwerp, Belgium. Princeton University Press established a European office, in Woodstock, England, north of Oxford, in 1999, and opened an additional office, in Beijing, in early 2017.\n\n"

The Bollingen Series was given to the university in 1969.\n\n"
