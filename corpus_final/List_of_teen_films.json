            "text": "\nTeen film is a film genre targeted at teenagers and young adults in which the plot is based upon the lives of teenagers and young adults, such as coming of age, first love, rebellion, conflict with parents, teen angst, and alienation and other topics / issues in the personal and professional lives of teenagers & young adults. Some of these films are targeted at adults as well as teenagers. Teen films have been a trope of the cinema industry that grew in popularity in the 1950s.[1][2] At this time, the film industry saw a greater market for teens with more disposable income and therefore more money to spend on leisure activities, largely going to films. Because of the boom in teen viewers, drive-in movie theaters were also very popular.[2]  However, teen films have been produced since the dawn of the 20th century.  Recently, online streaming services such as Netflix have created a resurgence in the \"tween\" and teenage-oriented film.[3]\n\n"
