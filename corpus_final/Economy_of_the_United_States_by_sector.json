A standardized classification of the economy into sectors makes it possible to compare census results over time.  However, to reflect the evolving nature of the economy, the NAICS is updated every five years.  Therefore, when comparing different censuses, a particular NAICS basis is usually specified.  The following data are based on a comparison of the 2007 and 2002 censuses using the 2002 NAICS basis and an older comparison of the 1997 and 2002 censuses using the older 1997 NAICS basis.  Thus, (*) the 1997 data are based on a slightly different classification than the 2007 and 2002 data.\n\n"
