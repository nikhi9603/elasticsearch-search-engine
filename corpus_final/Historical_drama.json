The costume drama is often separated as a genre of historical dramas. Early critics defined them as films focusing on romance and relationships in sumptuous surroundings, contrasting them with other historical dramas believed to have more serious themes. Other critics have defended costume dramas, and argued that they are disparaged because they are a genre directed towards women.[1] Historical dramas have also been described as a conservative genre, glorifying an imagined past that never existed.[2]\n\n"

Works may also include mostly-fictionalized narratives based on actual people or historical events, such as Apollo 13, Braveheart, Chernobyl, Enemy at the Gates, Les Mis√©rables, and Titanic.[3]\n\nWorks that focus on accurately portraying specific historical events or persons are instead known as docudrama, such as The Report. Where a person's life is central to the story, such a work is known as biographical drama, with notable examples being films such as Alexander,[4] Cinderella Man, Frida, House of Saddam, Lincoln, Stalin, and W..\n\n"
