            "text": "A featurette is a film usually of three to four reels in length, or about 22–43 minutes in running time,[citation needed] thus longer than a two-reel short subject but shorter than a feature film. Hence, it is a \"small feature\" (the ending \"-ette\" is a common diminutive suffix derived from French[1]), and in fact featurettes were sometimes called \"streamlined features\". Featurette was commonly used from before the start of the sound era into the 1960s, when films of such length as the Hal Roach's Streamliners—and several French films of that length—ceased being made, or were made as experimental or art films and subsumed under the more general rubric of short film.[citation needed] Some featurettes are still being produced, notably the action comedy Kung Fury, which runs only 31 minutes.\n\n"
