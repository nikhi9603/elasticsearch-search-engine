The obverse of the coin features a portrait of George Washington facing right.[3]  This design was not chosen for production, and the Shield nickel was produced instead, although some patterns of the Washington nickel utilized some of the reverse designs that were eventually adopted for the Shield nickel.\n\nThe 1866 Washington nickel is relatively common for a pattern coin, and is popular with coin collectors.[4]\n\n"

The coin was produced in two major varieties, one with Washington facing right and one facing left.[5]  Only seven pieces are known to exist, all of which are in the National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nTwo coins with Washington facing left were struck in 1910. These, like the 1909 pieces, are at the Smithsonian.[6]\n\n"
