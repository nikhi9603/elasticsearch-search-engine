            "text": "\nGuerrilla filmmaking refers to a form of independent filmmaking characterized by ultra-low micro budgets, skeleton crews, and limited props using whatever resources, locations and equipment is available. Often scenes are shot quickly in real locations without any warning, and without obtaining filming permits.\n\nIndependent filmmakers typically resort to guerrilla filmmaking because they don't have the budget or time to obtain permits, rent out locations, or build expensive sets. Larger and more \"mainstream\" film studios tend to avoid guerrilla filmmaking tactics because of the risk of being sued, fined or having their reputation damaged due to negative publicity.\n\nAccording to Yukon Film Commission Manager Mark Hill, \"Guerrilla filmmaking is driven by passion with whatever means at hand\".[1]\n\n"

El Mariachi, which was shot for around $7,000 with money partially raised by volunteering in medical research studies, won the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival in 1992. The film, originally intended for the Spanish-language low-budget home-video market, was distributed by Columbia Pictures in the United States.

The book and film would inspire other filmmakers to pick up cameras and make no-budget movies.[8]\n\nPi, directed by Darren Aronofsky,[9] was made on a budget of $68,000. It proved to be a financial success at the box office ($4.6 million gross worldwide).[10] Aronofsky raised money for the project by selling $100 shares in the film to family and friends, and was able to pay them all back with a $50 profit per-share when the film was sold to Artisan.[citation needed]\n\nTroma Entertainment is a film production and distribution company founded by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz in 1974. The company produces low-budget independent films, many of which have developed cult followings. Kaufman has been outspoken about their use of guerrilla marketing and tolerance of piracy, and he has written the books All I Need to Know about Filmmaking I Learned from the Toxic Avenger and Make Your Own Damn Movie!, which outline his philosophy of quick and inexpensive independent film.[11]\n\nParanormal Activity, directed by first time director Oren Peli, was shot for approximately $10,000.

The guerrilla-style techniques implemented were used as part of the story itself, to represent the amateur production within the story.  It was shot with a budget of less than $3,000 with a Canon XL2 and a Panasonic AG-DVX100. The director opted out of using a steadicam purposefully to achieve more shakiness. It was awarded Outstanding Lead Actor in a comedy or mockumentary by The 2013 LA Web Series Festival and deemed \"a gonzomentary truly realized\" by Mark Bell of Film Threat.[14]\n\nMidnight Rider, a biopic of Gregg Allman, attempted to use guerrilla filmmaking methods to illegally film a sequence on a railroad bridge in active use.
