The timeline contains all flights which have crossed the edge of space, were intended to do so but failed, or are planned in the near future. Significant test flights of spaceflight systems may be listed even if they were not planned to reach space. Some lists are further divided into orbital launches (sending a payload into orbit, whether successful or not) and suborbital flights (e.g. ballistic missiles, sounding rockets, experimental spacecraft).\n\n"
