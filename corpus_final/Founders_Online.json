            "text": "The Founders Online website, launched on June 13, 2013, enables students, researchers, scholars, and the general public to read what the Founders wrote and debated in the years leading up to and following the nation's formation. The subjects they discussed between themselves and others ranged from public policies and democratic principles to slavery and the Constitution. The works available also provide insight into the Founders' friendships and personal lives.[1]\n\nThe website's collection is the result of a 50-year effort by scholars to locate, transcribe, annotate, and digitize 18th and 19th century documents held by archives worldwide. From these works, hundreds of individual volumes have been published that can also be accessed.[1][3]\n\nThe collection is derived from the letterpress editions of the Founders' original papers, which were drawn from the following sources:[5]\n\nBesides the complete works of these individuals, Founders Online includes the selected papers of John Jay, first Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.[5] Eventually, the website's collection is expected to exceed 200,000 documents.[2][6] The website is based at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.\n\n"
