Since Gongylus mantises have been fascinating entomologists and have been bred in captivity for a long time, their behavior and breeding preferences are well known, such as a defensive behavior of displaying a hissing noise by rubbing the anterior edges of its serrated fore wings to the femur of the hind legs.[1]\n\n"

            "text": "The about 28 species of empusid mantis[2] are all relatively large and bizarre looking. The prothorax is always surrounded by a crest and the femur of the middle and hind legs often have flap-like appendages. The pronotum is characteristically elongated and the abdomen is often lobed.[5] Members of the Mantoidea superfamily possess a cyclopean ear, an organ situated on the metathorax, which has been proven to be an adaptation to bat predation. The presence of this adaptation has been dated to originate in the early Eocene.[6]\n\n"

            "title": "Phylogeny",
            "text": "The Empusidae belong to the superfamily Hymenopoidea, together with the Hymenopodidae.[6] Phylogenetic studies place the Empusidae as a sister group to the Hymenopodidae. The Empusidae and Hymenopodidae are, in turn, placed as sister groups to all other ambush mantises.[4] [3]. Two subfamilies are placed within the Empusidae, Blepharodinae, and Empusinae. The Blepharodinae subfamily holds three genera: Blepharodes, Blepharopsis and Idolomantis. The Empusinae subfamily is divided into two tribes, the Empusini and Idolomorphini. The Empusini tribe holds five genera, Dilatempusa, Empusa, Gonglyus, and Hypsicorypha. The Idolomorphini tribe holds the three remaining genera, Hemiempusa, Idolomorpha, and Chopardempusa.[2] The latest phylogeny was revised by Svenson et al. 2015.[1]\n\n"

            "text": "In 2017-2018, a rock carving of an Empusidae with raptorial forearms was revealed in the Teimareh rock art site in the Khomeyn County, Iran. An engraved, insect-like image has a 14-cm length and 11-cm width with two circles at its sides which probably dates 40,000–4,000 years back. This motif is analogous to the famous 'squatter man' petroglyph encountered at several locations around the world.[7][8][9][10]\n\n"
