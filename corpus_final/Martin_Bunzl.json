In language accessible to historians, philosophers, and the reading public more generally, he explores the questions posed by the various 'turns' of the post-war decades: deconstructive, linguistic, literary, anthropological, and quantitative. He looks not just at what historians say about their methods, but at what they actually do.\"[3]\n\nWith a specialty in the Philosophy of Science, he is the author of The Context Of Explanation,[4] Real History[5] and Uncertainty and the Philosophy of Climate Change,[6] and co-editor of Buying Freedom[7] and Foundational Issues in Human Brain Mapping,[8] as well as numerous scholarly articles.\n\nBunzl's current research is in the area of catastrophic risk.\n\n"
