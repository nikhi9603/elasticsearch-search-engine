            "text": "The Western religions are the religions that originated within Western culture, which are thus historically, culturally, and theologically distinct from Eastern, African and Iranian religions. The term Abrahamic religions (Islam, Christianity and Judaism) is often used instead of using the East and West terminology, as these originated in the [Middle East].\n\nWestern culture itself was significantly influenced by the emergence of Christianity and its adoption as the state church of the Roman Empire in the late 4th century and the term \"Christendom\" largely indicates this intertwined history.[1] Western Christianity was significantly influenced by Hellenistic religion (notably neoplatonism) as well as the Roman imperial cult. Western Christianity is based on Roman Catholicism (Latin Rite), as opposed to Eastern Orthodoxy, from which it was divided by the Great Schism of the 11th century, and further includes all Protestant traditions splitting off Roman Catholicism from the 16th century.\n\nSince the 19th century, Western religion has diversified into numerous new religious movements, including Occultism, Spiritism and diverse forms of Neopaganism.\n\n"

            "text": "\"The West\" as a culture or civilization historically evolved out of Greco-Roman classical antiquity. These cultures had polytheistic religions, viz. Greek polytheism and Roman polytheism. \"Eastern\" influences on these religions are evident from the earliest times, the Orientalizing period at the very beginning of Greek antiquity.\n\nDuring Hellenism and the Roman Empire period, \"Eastern\" (Oriental) religions exerted a considerable influence on \"Western\" religion, giving rise to Persian influenced traditions like Gnosticism and Mithraism, as well as Egyptian and \"Chaldean\" influence on mystery religions (Orphism), astrology and magic. Early Christianity itself is a further example of Orientalizing influence on the later Roman Empire.\n\nDuring the same period, inherited traditions of native Roman religion were marginalized or overlaid by interpretatio graeca, and the Roman imperial cult evolved into a civil religion which involved state ritual rather than religious faith or experience. Celtic and Germanic religion was described by Roman ethnography as primitive, but at the same time as pure or unspoiled compared to the so-called urban decadence of Rome.\n\n"

Western Christianity itself was divided by the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, and pronouncedly \"Western\" forms of Christianity include Puritanism and Evangelicalism, movements resulting from the various \"Great Awakenings\" in the 18th to 20th century English-speaking world and popularly practiced in the United States.\n\nFor at least a millennium and a half, Europe has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture.[2] The Christian culture was the predominant force in Western civilization, guiding the course of philosophy, art, music, science, social structure and architecture.[3][4]\n\n"

            "text": "Following the religious wars of the 16th to 17th centuries, the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century paved the way for a detachment of society and politics from religious questions. Inspired by the American Revolution, the French Revolution brought the idea of secularization and a laicist state granting freedom of religion to Europe. After the turmoils of the Napoleonic Wars, this development caught hold in other parts of Europe, utilizing the German mediatization and the separation of church and state in various European constitutions drawn up after the revolutions of 1848.\n\n"

            "text": "The principle of religious freedom introduced in Western society in the early 19th century facilitated the emergence of various new religious movements. First examples were derived from western occultism and the tradition of secret societies such as the Freemasons, but from the later 19th century, the influence of Eastern religions, notably Buddhism and Hinduism played an increasing role. From the mid 20th century, Eastern and Western spiritual traditions were increasingly syncretized in the various movements associated with the New Age and Neopagan countercultures.\n\n"

This is a reflection of the tradition of secular humanism which culminated in the 18th century Age of Enlightenment.[12][13][14]\n\nThere remains a minority of the order of 5% of the population in the Western world which adheres to non-Western religions, mostly due to recent immigration, but to some extent also due to proselytization, notably conversion to various sects of Buddhism and Hinduism in the context of the New Age movement in the later part of the 20th century.\n\n"
