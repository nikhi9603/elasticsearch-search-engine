In reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIPRESCI announced that it will not participate in festivals and other events organized by the Russian government and its offices, and canceled a colloquium in St. Petersburg, that was to make it familiar with new Russian films.[2]\n\n"

It is the federation’s most representative acknowledgement, as it is not chosen by a jury (like the international critics prize awarded to a film from a festival program), but is elected by all members, and all feature-length productions of the previous twelve months are eligible.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson is the only director to win this award three times.\n\n"
