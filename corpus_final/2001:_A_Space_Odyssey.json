It is a part of Clarke's Space Odyssey series, the first of four novels and two films. Both the novel and the film are partially based on Clarke's 1948 short story \"The Sentinel\", an entry in a BBC short story competition, and \"Encounter in the Dawn\", published in 1953 in the magazine Amazing Stories.\n\n"

These included \"Breaking Strain\", \"Out of the Cradle, Endlessly Orbiting...\", \"Who's There?\", \"Into the Comet\", and \"Before Eden\".[1] Additionally, important elements from two more Clarke stories, \"Encounter in the Dawn\" and (to a somewhat lesser extent) \"Rescue Party\", made their way into the finished project.[2]\n\n"
