The desired characteristics of a technology scout are similar to the characteristics associated with the technological gatekeeper.  These characteristics include being a lateral thinker, knowledgeable in science and technology, respected inside the company, cross-disciplinary orientated, and imaginative personality.[1] Technology scouts would also often play a vital role in a formalised technology foresight process.[12]\n\n"
