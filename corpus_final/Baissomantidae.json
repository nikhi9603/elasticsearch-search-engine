There are two known genera, Baissomantis, known from the Early Cretaceous Zaza Formation of Buryatia, Russia,[1] and Labradormantis from the mid Cretaceous (Cenomanian) Redmond Formation of Labrador, Canada. They are amongst the most primitive mantises known, only more advanced than Santanmantis.[2]\n\n"
