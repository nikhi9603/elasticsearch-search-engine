            "text": "Ilkley Moor is an area of moorland between Ilkley and Keighley in West Yorkshire, England.[1] It is well-known as the inspiration for the song On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at.[1] It is also known for its carved rocks, particularly the Swastika Stone.[1] There have been many UFO sightings on the moor.[2][3][4] Sceptics have suggested that this is because of the nearby proximity of Menwith Hill airforce base and Leeds Bradford Airport.[2][4][5]\n\nPhilip Spencer (a pseudonym[6][7]) had moved from London to remote West Yorkshire with his wife and child in order to be closer to his wife’s family following his retirement from the police force.[8] On the morning of 1 December 1987 Spencer began walking across Ilkley Moor to visit his father-in-law in East Morton.[8] He had taken a camera with him as well as a compass, in case there was fog.[2]\n\n"

            "text": "According to Spencer, he was walking up a small hill when he noticed an odd-looking figure just up the trail ahead of him.[2] It was dark green and about four feet tall[2] with an oversized head and long, thin arms.[9] The creature made a gesture at Spencer, which he took to be a gesture telling him to stay away, but he took out his camera and took a picture of it.[2][9] The creature then ran away and Spencer followed it.[9] He lost the creature in the fog but then saw a craft rise from the moor and disappear into the sky.[8] He described the craft as being of a whitish colour and consisted of two saucer shaped parts that were attached, with one being on top of the other.[8] There was also a loud hum.[8] He did not take a photograph of the craft.[2][5]\n\nRather than continue with his planned route, Spencer headed to another town that was about a half hour away.[9] When he arrived he discovered that it was about two hours later in the day than he expected it to be.[9] Additionally, the compass that he had taken with him was pointed in the opposite direction than it should have.[8]\n\n"

            "text": "In the days following the alleged incident Spencer made contact with UFO researchers Jenny Randles and Peter Hough.[9] Hough claimed to have been “extremely sceptical” at first but later came to believe Spencer.[6] Spencer handed over the copyright of the photo to Hough.[10] Although the story quickly made the news Spencer insisted on keeping his anonymity.[6][9] Various write-ups of the case have made it clear that Spencer did not make any money from the story.[5]\n\nAs well as examining the site, Hough sent the photograph to a number of experts.[2] A wildlife photographer who examined the photograph said that it was not from any known animal.[5] Experts from the Kodak laboratory in Hemel Hempstead said that they could not detect any evidence of tampering.[5] Dr. Bruce Maccabee a US Navy optics expert and ufologist concluded that the photograph was “too grainy for proper testing”.[8][5]\n\nAccording to ufologist Nick Redfern, Spencer was hassled by the Ministry of Defence a few days after the incident on the moor.[11] He says that they opened a file on Spencer and sent two Men in black to his home to intimidate him into silence.[11]\n\n"

            "text": "While the photograph was being examined Spencer claimed that he experienced strange dreams.[2] Following Hough’s advice he attended a session of regressive hypnotherapy.[8] This was carried out by Dr. Jim Singleton on 16 March 1988.[8] Under hypnosis Spencer’s original account of the incident changed.[10] Singleton has called it a “genuine recall”.[6]\n\nSpencer now recalled that upon seeing the creature on the hill he was instantly paralysed.[2] He was then lifted up a few feet and pulled into the craft.[2] When he entered the craft a voice told him to be calm.[2][8] A group of green aliens then performed medical experiments on him, inserting items into his nose and mouth.[2][8] He was given a tour of the craft [2][10] and shown a film.[2] The film showed apocalyptic imagery, including nuclear explosions, famines and floods.[2] Spencer was then shown a second film.[2] He has never revealed the contents of the second film, saying that the aliens who abducted him do not want humanity to know.[2]\n\nFollowing this Spencer was returned to Ilkley Moor, where he then took the famous photograph.[2] He claimed that the alien was actually waving goodbye to him, not telling him to stay away, as in his original account.[2]\n\n"
