            "text": "Chadbourne was born in Mount Vernon, New York, but grew up in Boulder, Colorado.[1] He started playing guitar when he was eleven or twelve, inspired by the Beatles[2] and hoping to get the attention of girls.[3] Although he was drawn to Jimi Hendrix and played in a garage band, he found rock and pop music too conventional. He gravitated to the avant-garde jazz of Anthony Braxton and Derek Bailey.[2] Braxton persuaded Chadbourne to abandon his intention to enter journalism and instead pursue music.[3]\n\nDuring the early 1970s, he lived in Canada to avoid military service in the Vietnam War.[2][4] Returning to the United States, he moved to New York City in the mid 1970s and played free improvisation with Henry Kaiser and John Zorn. Around this time, he released his first album, Solo Acoustic Guitar. In the early 1980s, he led the avant-rock band Shockabilly[2][3][5] with Mark Kramer and David Licht.[6]\n\nChadbourne explored other genres, playing with a Cajun band and a Russian folk band at a festival in Winnipeg. He mixed country, Western, and improvisation in the band LSD C&W.[2][3] For many years he was in a duo with Jimmy Carl Black, who played drums for Frank Zappa. He has also worked with Han Bennink, Fred Frith, Elliott Sharp, and Charles Tyler.[3]\n\nA solo album, Songs (Intakt, 1993), featured politically oriented originals, such as \"Hello Ceausescu\", and covers, such as Nick Drake's \"Thoughts of Mary Jane\", Phil Ochs' \"Knock on the Door\"and Floyd Tillman's \"This Cold War With You\".\n\nChadbourne invented an instrument known as the electric rake by attaching an electric guitar pickup to a rake.[7] He played a duet of electric rake and classical piano with Bob Wiseman on Wiseman's 1991 album Presented by Lake Michigan Soda. He also played the instrument on a Sun Ra tribute album.\n\n"
