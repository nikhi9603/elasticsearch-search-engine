            "text": "Sylvester Judd III was born on July 23, 1813, in Westhampton, Massachusetts[1] to Sylvester Judd II and Apphia Hall, a daughter of Aaron Hall of Norwich, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, a one-year attendee at Harvard, and later modest justice of the peace.[2] His great-grandfather was Rev. Jonathan Judd (1719-1803), a clergyman of Southampton, while his grandfather ran the family store.  His father, after working in the store in his boyhood, went to Boston for several years, where, according to Judd's sister's biography, he became a voracious reader, returning to the family business, but then becoming editor of the Hampshire Gazette.  Sylvester Judd III studied at Hopkins Academy in Hadley, Massachusetts, where he was president of the Literary Society and delivered the valedictorian address.  He graduated from Yale College in 1836, and from Harvard Divinity School in 1840. His dissertation was entitled The Uses of Intellectual Philosophy to the Preacher.  While a student, on April 4, 1838, Judd traveled to Concord, Massachusetts to meet Ralph Waldo Emerson after reading his essay \"Epic Poetry\". Emerson was pleased by Judd's interest in seeking a mystical identification with Christ.[3] Judd may have been in the audience on August 31, 1837, and heard Emerson's commencement speech to the Phi Beta Kappa Society known as \"The American Scholar\".\n\nJudd was ordained a Unitarian minister on October 1, 1840, becoming pastor of a church in Augusta, Maine. He was a member of the Maine Peace Society which was anti-war and sought justice through a World Court.  Early in 1841, Judd met Jane Elizabeth Williams, the daughter of United States Senator Reuel Williams.[4] The couple married on August 31, 1841; they had three daughters:  Jane Elizabeth (September 26, 1844), Frances Hall (June 28, 1847), and Apphia Williams (March 16, 1853).  Judd's third daughter was born two months after his death.  His second daughter, Frances, married the Unitarian minister Seth Curtis Beach on November 17, 1869. Their son, Reuel W. Beach (Harvard graduate, married Ruth Walcott Stetson in 1909), and grandson, Curtis Beach, were both Unitarian ministers. Frances and Seth Beach's second son, Dr. Sylvester Judd Beach, lived from 1879-1953, residing in Portland, ME. Dr. Beach served as President of the Wayflete School in Portland, bringing progressive education to the school. Sylvester Judd's sister, Apphia Putnam Judd (born Oct 27, 1820 in Westhampton; died 1901 in Augusta), married his wife's brother, Joseph Hartwell Williams (1814-1896), who was the 27th governor of Maine (1857-1858).\n\n"

            "title": "Influences",
            "text": "According to Philip Brockway, Judd's early influences were Calvinist puritanism.  After a spiritual conversion to Unitarianism as a young man, his readings took on wide spheres, particularly while at Yale College and then Harvard Divinity School.  His readings included the poetry of Jones Very, the writings of Thomas Carlyle, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Robert Owen,  Goethe's Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, Goethe's Conversations with a Child by Bettina von Arnim, and the writings of the foremost Unitarian ministers of their day, William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\nBrockway cites Emerson's journal entry from 1852, the year before Judd's death at 40:  \"I saw Judd in Augusta [Maine], in February, and asked him who his companions were.  He said, 'Sunsets.' I told him I thought they needed men. He said, 'I'm a priest and converse with the sick and dying.'\"\n\n"

            "title": "Criticism",
            "text": "American critic and poet James Russell Lowell called Judd's novel Margaret \"the most emphatically American book ever written\".[5] He mentioned the novel in his long satire A Fable for Critics (1848) as \"the first Yankee book / With the soul of Down East in 't, and things farther East\".[6] In a 39-page review, however, critic William Bourne Oliver Peabody called the work unfinished and its characters and style inconsistent.[7] After publishing his novel Philo, Judd sent a copy to Edward Everett Hale, who responded, \"I think Philo glorious.\"[8]\n\nThe critic and poet Richard J. Powers finds the child characterization of Margaret in the novel the prototype for Nathaniel Hawthorne's character of Pearl, Hester Prynne's daughter, in the 1850 novel The Scarlet Letter.\n\n"
