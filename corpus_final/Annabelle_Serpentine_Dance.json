            "text": "The dance is performed in succession in a lockoff shot. The first is in a flowing skirt, held out by her hands with arms extended. She smiles, wearing butterfly wings on her back and the wings of Mercury in her hair. Her dance emphasizes the movement of her visible, bare legs. She kicks high, bows, and moves to her right and left. The second dancer has a voluminous, long skirt, and holds sticks in each hand attached to the skirt's outer edges. The flowing patterns of the skirt from her arm movements give the second scene a different feeling from the first.\n\n"

Dickson and William Heise. Heise was also producer and camera operator.\n\nFilm historians have commented on the possibilities for viewers to slow down the hand cranking of the footage; it was not technically possible in other art forms.[3]\n\n"
