            "text": "Glover auditioned in Charlotte, North Carolina.[6] She previously auditioned in the ninth and eleventh seasons. In the ninth season Simon Cowell said that he could not see Glover being anything more than a lounge singer and she was cut during the final 70 round. She was eliminated by producers during the ninth season when she forgot the lyrics to her song \"Chasing Pavements\" by Adele.\n\nGlover auditioned in Savannah, Georgia. She sang \"Blame It on Me\" by Chrisette Michele. She advanced, but her audition was not aired. In round one, she performed Karina's \"Slow Motion\". In round three, she sang \"Someone like You\" by Adele, where she received a standing ovation from the judges. She performed \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" by Buddy Holly with eleventh season finalists DeAndre Brackensick and Jessica Sanchez in the group round and was eliminated.\n\nDuring her audition for the twelfth season, Glover sang \"Syrup & Honey\" by Duffy, where she received a standing ovation. Judge Randy Jackson said that she was the best performer by far in the competition. Mariah Carey called her singing \"The best singing we have heard thus far.\" Glover advanced to Hollywood. In an interview, she said, \"I thought they were going to get sick of seeing my face.\" For the first round in Hollywood, she sang \"Impossible\" by Christina Aguilera. For the second round, she performed \"Hit Em Up Style\" with Kamaria Ousley, Denise Jackson, and Melinda Ademi. This was named the best group the judges had seen all day. In round three, she put a jazzy twist on Alicia Keys's \"Girl on Fire\". It was later announced that Glover was one of the top 20 girls of the season and she advanced to Las Vegas. In Vegas, she performed \"Natural Woman\" by Aretha Franklin. In the semi-finals of the competition, Glover performed \"Ordinary People\" by John Legend. On March 7, 2013, she was voted into the Top 10.[1] Her Top 10 performance of \"I (Who Have Nothing)\" by Ben E. King earned her enough votes to land among the night's top three contestants, along with Kree Harrison and Angie Miller.[7] After her Top 6 performances, Glover earned enough votes to land in the night's top two contestants, along with Kree Harrison. She covered \"Lovesong\" by The Cure and broke down in tears after receiving a standing ovation. For the first time, after her Top 4 performance, she landed in the bottom two. On May 16, Glover won the contest and her debut single 'I Am Beautiful' was released to music store outlets.\n\n"
